# Week plan has everything your team needs to plan, manage and complete tasks.

### **High Impact Tasks**

Never lose sight of your most important tasks. Week Plan helps you to integrate all your high impact tasks into your schedule easily and always visible, so your team put their focus where it matters.

### **Add Sub Tasks**

Every big and high impact task start small. Subtasks help you to create an organized work breakdown structure to effectively manage a big task. Add as many subtasks as you want with their own description, deadlines, priority and more.

### **Set Repetitive Tasks**

Save tons of time by setting up tasks once, which repeat frequently. Add any recurring task like weekly meetings or reporting once and it will be automatically added to the schedule, whenever you want it to be.

### **Track Time on each task**

Measure the time it takes on each task or assign time to your or your team’s tasks.  With the built-in time tracker, track time for your entire team's tasks automatically.

### **Centralize your important tasks**

Having all your key tasks in a single place is essential to have a constant view of your tasks. Arrange them in a list and assign them the priority level. Add all tasks that are not unplanned and important in a parking lot and push them to the priority board, whenever you need to.

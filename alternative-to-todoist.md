### **_WeekPlan has helped me to keep my goals in focus and not just checking things off my long to-do list_**

 

Before I started using WeekPlan, I used to have every single task (important or not) on my to-do app. I felt somewhat productive checking things off each day, but I felt like I wasn't really going anywhere...I had no direction and no purpose. 

Now, I still use my to-do app for my "not-so-important/urgent" tasks, but I use WeekPlan to help keep me focused on what is important. It's so helpful to have my "big rocks" mapped out each week so I know what I need to work on instead of just putting out fires daily. I love the Goals feature. It allows me to set quarterly goals, break down the tasks associated with that goal, and actually schedule it to ensure it gets completed.

# **What’s New in Week Plan 2.104.1**

Week Plan is growing. Each week, our developers work hard to release new features and bug fixes. 

We’re committed to providing you with the best software that will help you become more effective.

## **Added New List Setting: Promote to Today**

Week Plan version 2.104.1 now features a new list setting that promotes tasks in any board to today. This allows you to easily prioritize tasks without having to change the dates. 

## **12-Hour Time Format Added**

We’ve also added a 12-hour time format for those who hate using a 24-hour clock. In the previous versions, you only had a 24-hour time. 

You can switch to a 12-hour clock by going to your Account Settings, then Preferences.

## **Tasks Can Appear in Boards and HIT List**

Additionally, your tasks can now appear in both in the board list and day list. 

## **Generate Permalinks to Tasks**

To make things easier for and your team, we’ve added an option to generate a permalink of your tasks. Copying a link to your clipboard allows you to share specific tasks to your team members. 

## **Implemented Global Tooltip**

Be sure to check out the global tooltip which neatly tells you what workspace you’re working on. 

## **Fixed: Can’t Assign Roles to Task**

Some of our users reported having difficulties assigning roles to asks. Well, we finally fixed the issue.

## **Fixed: Reset Time Tracked Value Issue**

Previously, the time tracked value could not be reset to zero. Now you can reset the time tracked of your tasks so it goes back to zero once you click the reset button.

## **Fixed: Week Cells Are Automatically Highlighted in Goal Section**

Moreover, there was a bug that automatically highlights the week cells in the Goals module. We’re happy to report that our developers have fixed this issue.

## **Fixed: Popover Scroll Bar** 

We’ve also fixed the obnoxious popover scroll bar that appeared on boards. 

## **Fixed: SMS Integration Issues**

Some of our users weren’t getting notifications via SMS while a few had issues adding tasks via SMS. With the latest update, everything should be seamless. We also fixed a few styling issues and updated the SMS integration help documents. 

## **Fixed: List Order Bug**

List ordering broke during our last deployment. We’ve fixed the bug. You can now edit and update list orders. 

## **Stay Tuned for More**

That’s it! Stay tuned for more awesome updates. We’re working hard to make Week Plan the best software to help you keep track of your goals, projects, and tasks. 

Thank's for using Week Plan.

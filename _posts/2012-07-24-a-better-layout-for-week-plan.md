Users have voted that Saturdays and Sundays should be bigger in WEEK PLAN.

It took me a while to figure out the best way to display all the information of the week without being too busy.<!--more-->




I wanted the user to always be able to see the goals (keep your goals in mind) and I wanted to give Saturday and Sunday more space without taking space from the other more used days.




This is why I came up with the horizontal scrolling navigation. On a normal screen, you can see your goals and 5 days at the same time. You can use the scrolling bar to see the two remaining.




This is how it looks like:

Also, it have moved the Someday tasks on their own screen as my own list start to be pretty big. Switching from one view to another doesnâ€™t load a new page though so it is very smooth to switch from one to another.




I hope you like it!

# **What’s New in Week Plan Version 2.109.1**

The biggest news is that Week Plan is now GDPR-compliant.

On May 25th, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect and we want to be transparent about how we store and protect your personal information.

We’ve devoted our resources to comply with GDPR. You can read our updated privacy policy[ here](https://weekplan.net/privacy/).

We've also added a bunch of new features and fixed a few bugs. Check out the details below.

## **Week Plan is Now GDPR-Compliant**

![](/assets/images/uploads/gdpr.png)Week Plan is committed to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We’ve added a new page that asks for your acceptance of our terms and privacy policy.

## **Removed Theme Option**

We’ve removed the theme option to make the overall experience simpler, without the fuss, so you can focus on what matters.

## **Removed Username From Registration Page**

We’re no longer requiring you to enter a username on the registration page.

## **Role-List: Don’t Show HITs That Are Scheduled**

When all high impact tasks (HITs) in a role have been scheduled, we show a nice green tick and a grey text that says “All HITs have been scheduled.”

## **Planner: Show Timeline Only When a Task is Dragged** 

![](/assets/images/uploads/Rec.gif)We’ve made the Planner simpler by showing only the timeline when a task is dragged over a list or when there are events in the day. Don’t forget to check out the cool hover effect! 

## **Tasks Now Appear on Lists and Dates**

In previous versions, if a task is in a list (e.g. Parking Lot) and you move it to Planner, the task disappears from the board and appears in the planner. In the latest update, dragging a task from a list to the Planner will not remove it from the list.

## **Stay Tuned for More**

Stay tuned for more cool updates. We’re working hard to make Week Plan the best tool to help you keep track of your goals, projects, and tasks.

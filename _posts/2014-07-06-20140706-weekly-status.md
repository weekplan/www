I have decided to start a new experiment. I will document what has been worked on this week in a weekly status blog post.



The idea is to show the progress made, and to document how we use WeekPlan to manage WeekPlan.

<div class="img-expand">![Weekly Status for WeekPlan](http://54.173.16.9/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/image_thumb.png "Weekly Status for WeekPlan")</div>


## Summary




The biggest focus was killing usability issues and publishing the app to multiple appstores.



WeekPlan can be found on the Windows Phone store, the Windows store, the Opera marketplace, the Firefox marketplace and the Amazon appstore.



Work has continued on new features for teams, like allowing @mentions and showing the time in the local time of the user.

## Learn to say ‘No’


<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your friends ask you to go to the movies, but the due date for an important term paper is tomorrow?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know you won’t be able to write anything if you go out, since you’ll go to have few drinks after the movie and your professor won’t extend the deadline for the term paper . In such situations, you’ll need to say no. Politely refuse to accept additional tasks if you think that you’re already overloaded with work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember you can not do everything in the world at the same time.</span>


## Embrace apps


At some point, you can't keep everything in your head. Moreover in today’s world of mobile phones and tablets this becomes highly helpful and simple. Helping you sharpen your sense of priority, [Weekplan](http://weekplan.net/) helps you highlight which tasks are important and which ones can be be taken care of later.

Letting go of the less important stuff will also relieve you from some of the stress that comes with the sheer amount of pending work.


## Create a dedicated study time


<span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin by analyzing what time of the day are you the most productive and alert. Then devote that time only for studying or completing homework. Focus and block out all your distractions at this time. Shut off your phone and respond to calls or texts when your work is finished. Don't check email or surf the Web (except when you need to for the work you're doing) during this time either. We suggest to check emails and social media stuff at set times everyday, for example 11am and 4pm.</span>

## Time block your week


<span style="font-weight: 400;">The same way you already have your classes already blocked out for you by your college schedule, we recommend you schedule your study and rest time in your weeks (as recurring events).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">([WeekPlan](http://weekplan.net/)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows you to set recurring tasks.)</span>

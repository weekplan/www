Yes, you can synchronize your Outlook data with Week Plan and vice-versa in real time.

To get started, make sure you get on the ULTIMATE plan or the PRO plan with the "Outlook calendar" feature selected.

Then all you'll need to do is follow these three steps below.

1. **Connect Your Outlook Calendar from Team Settings**
Sign in and visit the Team Settings tab from the top left menu and go to the section "Outlook Calendar".

2. **Authorize Week Plan to access your Outlook data**
Once, you click on "Synchronize With Outlook Calendar" tab, you will be requested to Sign In and enter your Outlook Credentials and allow WeekPlan to do the synchronization in real time.

WEEK PLAN implements the best of the wisdom of the latest time management literature.




**Weekly perspective**. I believe a weekly perspective enables me to better prepare ahead of time.

**Weekly goals.** I believe weekly goals help me focus on big enough chunks of work to see real progress and help me not lose focus.




**Balance**. I believe that trying to have at least one week goal per role helps me stay balanced.




**Stress free productivity**. I believe that listing every single thing I need to do or might want to do in the Someday list is very important. It helps me feel less stressed because my mind stops reminding me about these tasks.




**Unified management**. I believe work and personal life are better managed together from a task management point of view.




**Importance**. I believe that I should thrive to spend more time in areas that matter. When I add a new task in my system, I ask myself: “is it urgent?” “is it important to me?” and mark them accordingly using the Quadrant suffixes (! 2! 3!).




**Action-ability**. I believe that a task must be actionable. Instead of writing “Book doctor appointment”, I write the next action I have to take to make this happen, like “Find doctor’s phone number to book an appointment”. This simple tweak dramatically reduces procrastination.




**Self-reflection**. I believe self-reflection helps me stay aware of how I run my life. Every day WEEK PLAN sends me an email with a different question about my week. I found that these little questions help me find something to reflect on. I can simply reply to these emails to get my entry in my WEEK PLAN Journal.

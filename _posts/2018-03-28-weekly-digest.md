This article, titled [Visualizing the Meaning of Life: The Drip Coffee Model](https://medium.com/the-polymath-project/visualizing-the-meaning-of-life-the-drip-coffee-model-87a37e3d4040), delves into the meaning of life. 

Based on a book written by Iddo Landau, it argues that the meaning of life isn’t about a “yes” or a “no”. Rather, it’s about enough. 

So problems of meaning are really problems of insufficient value. Is your life meaningful? The better question to ask is, “Are there enough valuable experiences in your life?”

We all have blind spots. Blind spots are our inner biases that create delusions. 

The problem with blind spots is that you don’t know what you 
don’t know.

The key is self-awareness. This [article shows you how to conquer your blind spots](https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-elephant-in-your-life-how-to-conquer-your-blind-spots-dc5982372576).

**Fact**: you can’t be productive without getting enough sleep. 

Roughly one-third of the population is suffering from sleep deprivation according to the CDC. 

This [article details the devastating effects of hijacking sleep patterns](http://topshelfdiy.com/2018/03/24/the-1-productivity-killer-for-moms/). 

Unfortunately the article doesn't offer any solution to improve sleep. Here are two from us: valerian root (helps with my insomnia) and the good night drink: apple cider vinager plus honey mixed with hot water (this drink was made popular by Tim Ferriss)

When I was a student, I was too lazy to write entire journal entries but I still wanted to develop my self awareness.


In my journal, I would write just a few keywords that best described what was on my mind at the time instead of writing a full blown entry.


That’s how the concept of Cogitorama was born.


<!--more-->


The name Cogitorama comes from the latin “cogito” (thought) and the greek “-orama” (see).


I guess you could see it a bit like the Twitter of journaling, you keep the essential of journaling.


Let me give you an example, my cogitorama for today would be:


+australia +weekplan -bangkok -tired -hot


(As you can see, I am not a big fan of Bangkok…)


I prefix the positive keywords with a +, and the negative ones with a –.

## The Cogitorama extension for Week Plan



In WeekPlan, you can enable an extension to be able to use the Cogitorama concept, it looks like that:

Positive keywords are in green, negative in red.


The keywords that are used more regularly get shown bigger. Also, there is a global positivity score for the day to show you how you are feeling over time.

I hope some of you will find it useful!

My goal with weekplan and the mobile world is to make it very fast to add a new task. I want it to be possible to be in the middle of a discussion and to quickly jot down a task without having to wait ages for the app to start. At the moment, the mobile app/view is not a reflection of that vision. It still takes too long to load (which* *I am hoping to improve once I introduce the offline mode). But I have found a great alternative, which speed is hard to beat: adding a task via SMS is almost as fast as writing it on a paper notebook.<!--more-->

## How to start

1. Add a new contact on your phone called “weekplan” with the mobile number **+12077473362** (this is a US mobile number, there is no surcharge over the normal cost of a SMS to a US number).  
2. To link your phone number to your account, you simply need to send a SMS “Hi” to **+12077473362**.  
3. You will then receive instructions to link it to your weekplan account.  
    
## To add a task via SMS

Once your phone number has been registered, you will be able to add a task by sending “**Task **Whatever you want”:

## To see the list of tasks for today

Simply send the command **Today.**

## To mark a task as done

Simply send “**Done **NUMBER”. NUMBER being the number shown next to the next when you send the **Today **command.

## Other commands

You can also send:  
* “Workspaces”: sends the list of workspaces in your account.  
* “Workspace NUMBER”: changes the current workspace.  
* “?”: Show the help.

## New Video Tutorial on Using Goals

![Tutorial video on Goals](/assets/images/uploads/goals-video.png)

There seems to be some confusion on how to use the Goals module so we have now added a video tutorial that clearly explains how to use the **Goals** module. Have a look!

## Reorganized Edit Task Module

![Task edit modal reorganized](/assets/images/uploads/tasks.png)

We've reorganized the **Edit Task** module so it’s easier for you to use and understand Week Plan’s awesome features. 

You now have a **Scheduling** section for the calendar, duration settings, repetition settings, and reminders. 

Underneath it is the **Attributes** section, where you can assign roles, mark tasks as **Important** or **Urgent**, and view the time tracker.

We've also merged the **Notes** and **Comments** sections so it’s easier for you to access them without having to click multiple times.

## Security Improvements

We have spent some time improving the security of our system. 

## Fixed Redirecting Issue in Firefox

Some of our users were experiencing redirecting issues while using Week Plan on a Firefox browser. 

We are happy to announce that we’ve fixed the reported redirecting issues. 

Stay tuned for more awesome updates. 

If you have a feature request, [go on our support website](https://support.weekplan.net). 

Thank you for using Week Plan.

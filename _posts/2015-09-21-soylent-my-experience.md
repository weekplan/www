More than a year ago, I discovered [Soylent](https://www.soylent.com/) through the [founder’s blog where he was sharing his progress](http://robrhinehart.com/?p=474) in looking for a recipe for a complete meal replacement drink.


Soylent is basically a mash up of all the nutrients your body supposedly needs in a day.


## Benefits



I am attracted to the concept of being confident that I am giving my body the nutrients it needs throughout the day, and rather than hoping that the food I eat has enough of everything, I believe I can achieve a superior result by measuring my intake.


Some people are attracted to Soylent because it is generally cheaper than normal food (a DIY recipe could be as cheap as $5 a day), and some are attracted to it because it saves them time (2 minutes preparation if you use the official Soylent product or 10 minutes for a DIY version).


For me, I am attracted to the health benefits. The fact it is cheap and quick to make removes resistance to do it.


Also, I don’t want to replace all my meals with Soylent so I took a hybrid approach: breakfasts and lunches are replaced with Soylent and dinners stay “normal”. I have been doing that for a few months now and I am ready to reorder a new batch of ingredients.


## Soylent in Australia



Unfortunately I cannot buy Soylent easily from Australia, they still don’t deliver it down under so I started looking for alternatives. There is an online community of people who share recipes of Soylent alternatives using local ingredients: [DIY Soylent](https://diy.soylent.com/). After some browsing, I found a recipe that suited my needs: [Australian Soylent 1.0](https://diy.soylent.com/recipes/australian-soylent-10-improved-logistics-refined-nutrient-profiles-no-oil-wpc). (I found the recipe too sweet for my taste so I reduced the sugar)


I bought the ingredients online (three different shops) and 3 days later I had the ingredients I needed.

It takes me 10 minutes in the morning to prepare my day worth of drinks.


The final product:

## Results



**How does it taste? **For me it taste a bit like cake dough before baking it. I added cocoa and banana to vary the taste a bit.


**How do I feel during a Soylent day? **I don’t feel any different than other days. I don’t feel more alert like other people reported. I feel full until about 4pm. I have a fast metabolism and I generally am hungry at 10:30am.


**How about bowels problems? **People have reported having diarrhoea or smelly farts with Soylent. I don’t personally experience any major changes with this australian recipe.


**Headaches**: For a time, I bumped up the level of proteins to 180g a day but it was giving me headaches. Keeping it at 100g like in the recipe solved that problem.


**Colorful urine: **this is due to the excess vitamins from the multi-vitamins pills. Not really a problem but I decided to only take one of these pills instead of two.


Overall, I really enjoy having discovered Soylent and a way to have it here in Australia, I need to find more ways to vary the taste.

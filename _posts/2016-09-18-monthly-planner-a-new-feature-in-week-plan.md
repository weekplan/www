Many of you have been missing the ability to see more than a week ahead.

Although the product is called WEEK PLAN :), we agree that it makes sense sometimes to want to easily look ahead.<!--more-->

To open the month view, simply open the top left menu and you will find the “Monthly planner” menu item:

You will get a month view of your tasks, while still having access to your goals and parking lot:

Enjoy!

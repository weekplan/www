We told you we had a couple of exciting announcements coming up. 


**Today we are launching the two way integration with Google Calendar.**

## What it does
New events from Google Calendar will appear in your Week Plan (refreshed every hour).   
New tasks from your Week Plan will appear in Google Calendar.


## What it means
What is exciting about this new integration is that you can now access your Week Plan tasks everywhere Google Calendar is available. All the existing apps in the App Store or Google Play Store that work with Google Calendar will work with your Week Plan tasks too.


## How to enable this integration
This integration is available to Week Plan PRO users. If you are not a PRO user, [you can review the plan here](https://app.weekplan.net/#view=Pro).

To connect to your Google Calendar, [head to your workspace's settings page](https://app.weekplan.net/#view=WorkspaceSettings), you will find the Google Calendar section.

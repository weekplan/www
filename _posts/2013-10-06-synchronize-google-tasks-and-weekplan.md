**UPDATE: We no longer offer Google Tasks integration.**

Google Tasks synchronization is a feature available in the PRO plan of WeekPlan. This is how to set up the synchronization in WeekPlan.

* Go to your workspace’s settings:

* Click on “Synchronize with Google Tasks”
 
![Synchronize with Google Task](/assets/images/uploads/794-image1.png "Synchronize with Google Task")
 
* Log in to the Google account you want to synchronize with and give permission to the WeekPlan app:

![Give permission to WeekPlan app](/assets/images/uploads/794-image2.png "Give permission to WeekPlan app")

* You will be redirected back to WeekPlan. Select the Google Tasks bucket you want your week to be synchronized with:

Important: Do not forget to click the Save button!
 

That’s it. Your tasks will start being synchronized every hour.

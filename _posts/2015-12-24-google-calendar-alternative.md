In this post we’ll compare WEEK PLAN with [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/), a time-management app created by Google and available since 2006. WEEK PLAN is the best Google Calendar alternative in comparison to the other apps we have analyzed before (Todoist and Trello). <span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the fact that the user interface has similarities, there are some major differences too.</span>

Once again, we will provide you with a short comparison in terms of features, price, and time management concepts. This time, it’s Google Calendar’s turn to get under our magnifying glass!  <!--more-->

### Google Calendar and time management


Google Calendar is not based on a certain time management paradigm and doesn’t pack any productivity philosophy; actually, this app is similar to many other desktop calendar applications like Microsoft Outlook or iCal.

The app’s purpose is helping users keep track of events and ease collaboration with other event participants. Using Google Calendar is much like using a traditional agenda, plus some useful features you couldn’t enjoy if you chose to stick with the paper and pencil solution or organized events via email (communicating more easily with guests, adding attachments to events, and getting reminders).

The idea of prioritizing tasks is not included with Google Calendar, unless you want to implement this by yourself and choose a different color for urgent and/or important events.</td>

### What makes WEEK PLAN different


The difference between WEEK PLAN and other productivity tools is its vision on time management. While most apps help you become more “productive” by encouraging you to tick as many tasks as possible, this [weekly planner](http://weekplan.net) helps you keep your goals in mind and focus on what is the most important – or become more effective.

We put emphasis on completing the tasks that matter, not on ticking a large number of tasks so you feel overwhelmed and exhausted at the end of the day.

This is why you can mark tasks as **urgent and/or important** – so you **prioritize** activities and feel in control of your life.</td>

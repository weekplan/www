Today we would like to introduce you to the concept of P/PC: production / production capability. By finding the right balance between reaping the rewards and spending effort in maintaining your assets, you can reduce the urgency in your life. This concept was made popular by the book "7 habits of highly effective people" by S. Covey.


**Let’s say that both Joe and Sarah just bought the same car.** 

[time management vision](http://weekplan.net/online-course-time-management/) that Week Plan promotes is different. The idea is to become effective, not productive, by focusing on important things.


All tasks you have to complete each day fall under 4 different categories:

* [Pomodoro technique](http://weekplan.net/how-to-instantly-increase-your-productivity-today-using-the-pomodoro-technique/)
* Limit the amount of time you spend checking email and social media accounts

All these activities require extensive planning, structure, and even changing your lifestyle. If you keep following the old paradigm of focusing on urgent tasks, you’ll find it impossible to squeeze a workout session three times a week in your busy and unpredictable schedule or to call your old friends regularly. When the car is broken, thinking how to maintain it properly is out of the question and all you can think of is how to make it run another mile.

But, when you take care to maintain production capability, the car never breaks and you enjoy a steady, safe journey, where you also have time to admire the landscape and relax. What things will look like for you?

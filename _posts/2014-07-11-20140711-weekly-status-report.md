<div class="img-expand">![Weekly Status Report](http://54.173.16.9/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/image_thumb1.png "Weekly Status Report")</div>



## **Summary**




I finished writing a 30 pages ebook that explains the methodology behind WeekPlan. I am currently asking for feedback to polish the ebook. The goal is to send the ebook to people who signed up on the mailing list a long time ago to “warm up” the relationship with WeekPlan a bit.



We welcomed a new team member in the development team. Khurram has started helping us by writing more automated tests.



I spent some time clarifying some of the incoming work. Having three developers helping me means that things should go faster and I don’t want the requirements to be the bottleneck.



Lots of bugs have been squashed and some usability issues have been ironed out.



A new feature that has been added is the ability to @mention someone in a task notes or comment. The @mention will add that person to the task.

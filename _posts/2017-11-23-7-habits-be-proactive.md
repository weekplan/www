## <span style="font-weight: 400;">How to practice being proactive?</span>


I found that I could develop my sense of proactivity by tuning in with my daily frustrations. The more I'd realize what doesn't work around me, the more inclined I'd be to want to fix it if possible.


1.  <p class="qtext_para">Pay attention to what frustrates you in your day life and find a way to solve it if possible. By fixing the small issues of every day, we will start taking responsibility.


2.  <p class="qtext_para">Another way to start is to spend 5 minutes at night reflecting on your day and identify these frustrations and consider a potential solution. The next day, you try to actually apply what you came up with.

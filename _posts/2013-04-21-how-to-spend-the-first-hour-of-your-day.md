What you do during the first hour of the day can affect the rest of your day. Here is a list of things people enjoy doing first thing in the morning (after or before breakfast).<!--more-->

&nbsp;


## Plan your day


Review the things you have to do and the things you would like to achieve. If you start your day not knowing clearly what you need to do, your mind will create some resistance and you might end up procrastinating by working on lesser tasks. It can be as simple as writing a list of tasks on a piece of paper.

&nbsp;


## Meditate


In the morning, your mind should be more quiet than at the end of the day, so meditating should feel easier. Meditating improves your overall health and helps you focus better.

&nbsp;


## Exercise


The time before going to work is a great way to “find time” to do some sport. Getting your heart pumping in the morning will help you feel great during the rest of the day.

## Moment Of Enjoyment


Whether its breakfast with friends, reading a book or working in the garden, spend the first hour on something you love.

&nbsp;


## Sleep in :)


There are times where sleeping is the most productive thing you could do. If you are overworked and stressed, make sure you get enough sleep and exercise.

## UPDATE 1: Get to inbox zero


For the second time in 10 years, I have been able to reach Inbox Zero, no email is sitting in my inbox, they all have been replied to or added to the appropriate place in my task management system. Now every morning, I try to answer all the emails I receive during the night before I start my work day.

## Work on your side project


I realized that it is harder to manage to work on a side project after work than it is to do it before work. You are less tired and there are fewer interruptions. Give it a try!

What do you like to to do early in the morning?

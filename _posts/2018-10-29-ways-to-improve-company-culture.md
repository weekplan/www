I once worked for a media company in the technology space. Oh, it was a dream come true. Why wouldn’t it be?

I got the chance to write about the latest trends in tech. It was perfect. Until I discovered how the company treated its employees.

It turned out the company was handing over too many projects while pressuring their writers to finish everything immediately, all while expecting every single word to be perfect.

Although I loved the work, I decided to pack up my bags and quit. Because the company culture was bad.

This is how company culture was introduced to me. It wasn’t a good experience, but it opened my eyes to how important company culture is.

# What is Company Culture

What is a company culture? Putting it simply, company culture pertains to what the company as a whole is.

It defines the company’s work environment; it involves a wide variety of elements, such as the employees shared beliefs, values, goals and even expectations, it involves every element there is about the company.

Today, when you talk about good company culture, the gigantic company Google always comes into mind. According to their website, Google offers a relaxing environment for their employees with their informal atmosphere.

Their office is like a playground with various facilities they can use anytime, something they believe helps employees have fresher ideas compared to just sitting in their desks looking at their computer all day long.

Employees can contribute to projects, they are always encouraged to share ideas and raise questions. Everyone is heard and valued, that’s what makes Google’s company culture especially alluring.

# Why Company Culture is Important

Now, how do you enjoy going to work every day? In recent years, company culture has been considered an important factor for employees. It has somewhat become a trend.

Employees with good working environment tend to enjoy what they do. Company culture has been a magnet for more brilliant and talented employees who would love a more relaxing work atmosphere, people who you surely need for your company, it attracts them and makes them stay.

In exchange, those brilliant employees tend to perform much better because of the atmosphere and freedom provided with a good company culture.

And because your employees tend to stay longer, it results in a lower turnover rate, which then leads to better co-worker relationships.

Good company culture also adds to your brand’s name and identity. How you treat your employees would reflect how they perform or interact with work or in some instances, even with customers.

When you observe a fun company culture, this reflects to the customers, they will see your company or brand as fun loving. We all know a good name equals trust for most consumers. When they trust your company or brand, they tend to spend more on you, this then equals sales.

All in all, a good company culture boosts effectiveness and efficiency for everyone.

Today, there are some remote teams and bootstrapped startups that are having difficulties establishing a good company culture.

This can be a result of poor planning or limited resources, but this can actually be avoided.

Here are some tips to establish good company culture:

### 1. Establish Clear Company Values and Goals

A company is a group of people who work together to achieve one goal. Establishing clear company values and goals is a crucial part in establishing a good company culture. It would be beneficial for everyone when these are established ahead of time.

This organizes how the employees would view the company, their limits and the company’s expectations of them. And with one goal, they’ll be guided on what they should accomplish together.

### 2. Offer Flexibility

Company culture has evolved over time, but there are still those who practice traditional company cultures. There are problems with them though, such as how they usually treat their employees, treating them as mere employees without artistic freedom, observing regular working hours and expecting them to work in their desks all day long.

This comes as a problem for younger employees who mostly value artistic freedom and leisure, these factors affect their ability and efficiency. Thus, it would be better to offer flexibility.

An example is more flexible office time. Recent experiments on this show that flexible hours actually help boost their creativity and productivity because they have more time on their hands to do other necessary personal things which then lessens what they think of at the office, enabling them to focus more on work.

### 3. Empower and Encourage

Your employees are not just people who work for you; they’re an integral part of your company’s success no matter what their role may be.

With this, it is important to remember to empower and encourage them more to work hard. One way companies do this is by recognizing and rewarding deserving employees so they’d be encouraged to do their best every time.

### 4. Promote Trust

A company is made up of several people and conflicts arise at times. It would be beneficial to initiate trust within the company. Resolve conflicts immediately and fairly. Promoting trust boosts relationships in the company greatly.

### 5. Integrate Modern Tech to Ease the Job

There is never an easy job, so why make it worse? The beauty with today’s time is how advanced technology has gotten. It has eased our lives tremendously with just a push of a button.

Most companies use platforms wherein they centralize their work, this ease workload and avoid communication greatly. Here are examples of modern platforms you can utilize in your company:

* Slack
* HipChat
* Skype
* Google Apps for Business
* Trello
* Jira
* Asana
* Week Plan

These platforms can be utilized for a much more effective collaboration and project management.

### 6. Establish a Strong Team Relationship

Just like basketball, good teamwork wins the game. This can be said when it comes to your company, with one goal and one vision, you should strive hard to attain them together. Good teamwork comes from a strong team relationship. Employers can initiate such by organizing activities such as team building.

### 7. Hear What Your Employees Have to Say

One crucial step employers forget is hearing what the employees have to say. For sure, you’ve hired the best out of those who submitted their resumes. You made sure to accept those who are fitting for the job; these people have their own ideas and or issues when it comes to your company.

Hear them out, you’d never know they might have ideas that can boost your company or that can resolve existing issues. Collaboration is essential especially for growing companies, so make sure to hear what they have to say!

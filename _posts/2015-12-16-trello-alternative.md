[Trello](https://trello.com/), released in September 2011 and currently counting more than 5 million users. Just like we did last time with [Todoist](http://weekplan.net/todoist-alternative/), we will make a parallel between Week Plan and Trello in terms of features, price, and underlying concepts. Our goal is helping you decide which app suits your needs better and when to choose either of them.

## Trello features

*   Projects are called **boards**, and each board includes multiple lists (corresponding to tasks lists). Tasks or ideas are replaced by **cards**, which can be dragged and dropped from one list to the next as the project progresses
*   Cards can be associated attachments, comments, due dates, votes, and checklists
*   Easy collaboration and no more confusing email chains
*   Supports iPhone, Windows 8 and Android mobile platforms
*   Adding an unlimited number of tags
*   Can be used both at work and at home. Trello is recommended for projects like vacations, weddings, recipes, editorial calendars, job searches, etc.

## Week Plan features

*   Weekly view
*   Marking tasks as important and/or urgent
*   Formulating goals related to the various roles you play in your life (Partner, Father, Colleague, and so on)
*   Automatically moving tasks to the next day
*   Parking Lot for dumping ideas and using them later
*   Personal journal where you reflect on your day or week
*   Additional features included in the PRO version

## The paradigm used by Trello

Trello is based on the Japanese *kanban* project management paradigm, which focuses on just-in-time (JIT) production. This manufacturing system uses an instruction card sent along the production line in order to regulate the supply of components. The kanban system was adapted to other fields as well, including software development, due its advantages, such as reducing overload on team members, making sure results are delivered in time, and telling team members what to produce, when to produce, and how to do it. The team approach has a central role for Trello, and this project management app also encourages members to learn from experience and achieve progress by visualizing workflows.

## What makes Week Plan different

The difference between this [weekly planner](http://weekplan.net) and other productivity tools is its vision on time management. While most apps help you become more “productive” by encouraging you to tick as many tasks as possible, Week Plan helps you keep your goals in mind and focus on what is the most important – or **become more effective**. We put emphasis on completing the tasks that matter, not on ticking a large number of tasks so you feel overwhelmed and exhausted at the end of the day. This is why you can **mark tasks as urgent and/or important** – so you **prioritize** activities and feel in control of your life.

## Trello pricing

Users can sign up for Trello and enjoy most of its features for free. However, there is a Trello Gold version available at affordable costs:

*   $5 per month
*   $45 per year (saving 25%)

Another way of getting access to Trello Gold (without spending money) is inviting new members. Additional benefits of Trello Gold include:

*   Bigger card attachments (up to 250 MB)
*   Custom backgrounds, fun stickers, and customer emoji
*   Premium backgrounds and stickers
*   Saving the most frequently used searches

## Why would you choose Trello

Signing up for Trello is recommended when:

*   You prefer a logistics-like approach on projects
*   You want to know the status of each project immediately and supervising workflows is crucial for achieving success
*   You want to allow any member of the team to easily reflect on processes
*   You need to find motivation in past achievements, featured in the “Done” board
*   Tracking the progress of each team member is important

## Why would you choose Week Plan

Here’s what Week Plan has to offer:

*   A new and successful vision on how to get things done
*   Learning how to become more effective and [de-clutter](http://weekplan.net/when-to-spend-money-instead-of-time/) your weekly schedule
*   Thinking in terms of roles
*   Planning and managing tasks week by week
*   Fresh content and advice on how to become more effective
*   Great features for [teams](http://weekplan.net/team-task-management/)

Even though both apps have a similar aim – helping you to get things done - they are simply different in terms of project management philosophy, layout, and features. It's actually difficult to place <a href="http://www.fromdev.com/2015/11/why-trello.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Trello</a> and Week Plan on the same scale for comparison purposes. If we were to find some similarities between the two apps, we would mention the focus on teamwork and the possibility to reflect on project progress. Yet, what makes Week Plan stand out as a Trello alternative is its focus on goals, roles and task prioritization.

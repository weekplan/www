[Trello](https://trello.com/), released in September 2011 and currently counting more than 5 million users. Just like we did last time with [Todoist](http://weekplan.net/todoist-alternative/), we will make a parallel between WEEK PLAN and Trello in terms of features, price, and underlying concepts. Our goal is helping you decide which app suits your needs better and when to choose either of them.

### The paradigm used by Trello


Trello is based on the Japanese *kanban* project management paradigm, which focuses on just-in-time (JIT) production. This manufacturing system uses an instruction card sent along the production line in order to regulate the supply of components. The kanban system was adapted to other fields as well, including software development, due its advantages, such as reducing overload on team members, making sure results are delivered in time, and telling team members what to produce, when to produce, and how to do it. The team approach has a central role for Trello, and this project management app also encourages members to learn from experience and achieve progress by visualizing workflows.</td>

### What makes WEEK PLAN different


The difference between this [weekly planner](http://weekplan.net) and other productivity tools is its vision on time management. While most apps help you become more “productive” by encouraging you to tick as many tasks as possible, WEEK PLAN helps you keep your goals in mind and focus on what is the most important – or **become more effective**. We put emphasis on completing the tasks that matter, not on ticking a large number of tasks so you feel overwhelmed and exhausted at the end of the day. This is why you can **mark tasks as urgent and/or important** – so you **prioritize** activities and feel in control of your life.</td>

Even though both apps have a similar aim – helping you to get things done - they are simply different in terms of project management philosophy, layout, and features. It's actually difficult to place <a href="http://www.fromdev.com/2015/11/why-trello.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Trello</a> and WEEK PLAN on the same scale for comparison purposes. If we were to find some similarities between the two apps, we would mention the focus on teamwork and the possibility to reflect on project progress. Yet, what makes WEEK PLAN stand out as a Trello alternative is its focus on roles and task prioritizing.

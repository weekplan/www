Do you live your life as it comes (reactive approach) or do you prefer to live with purpose according to a plan (proactive approach)?



As the founder of [WEEK PLAN](http://weekplan.net/), I try to expose my readership to new interesting techniques that can help them be more effective.



Today, I share a new tool called **MY IDEAL WEEK**:

<div class="img-expand">![Screenshot of my own ideal week](/assets/images/uploads/1196-1434956009.jpg)</div>


The concept is very simple: imagine what your ideal week would look like* if you had 100% control over your time*. 



I believe it is essential to color code your ideal week. It helps you find imbalance and attach you emotionally to this piece of paper. I personally use green for "Sharpen the saw" kind of activities, pink for relationships, blue for creative work, and grey for chores. 



Some comments on my ideal week:   

1. As you can see I still spend a lot of time consulting while I am bootstrapping WEEKPLAN. My true ideal week would replace consulting with Development work for WEEK PLAN.  

2. I don't plan much of my weekends. The weekends are the days I have the least control of.  

3. I like to give each day a focus theme (admin, consulting, dev, etc...).



I have turned MY IDEAL WEEK into a PDF that [you can download here](http://54.173.16.9/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MY-IDEAL-WEEK.pdf). [[version with am/pm format]](http://54.173.16.9/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/my-ideal-week-pm-time.pdf) [[version with Sunday first]](http://54.173.16.9/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/my-ideal-week-sunday-first.pdf)



Enjoy!

<h2 style="text-align: left">Liquids


<p style="text-align: left"><span style="text-align: justify">Often overlooked, liquids are essential in every weather and in every part of the world because it is required by your body more than anything.

So get your water bottle ready. Replenishers like lemonade and water based drinks (non sugar) will keep you hydrated and replenish those important electrolytes that the body needs on regular basis.</span>

<p style="text-align: left">**To maximize productivity and brain functioning, here are the essential foods to boost energy and mental strength.**


<h2 style="text-align: left">Dry** fruits**

<p style="text-align: justify">One study even shows that mothers who get enough DHA have smarter kids. A quarter cup of walnuts provides nearly 100% of the recommended daily intake of DHA. They also make you handle stress more easily. Also containing - Omega 3 Fatty acids, a significant oil which improves cognitive performance, guards against mental problems and cardiovascular problems. It is also present in significant amounts in Fish.


<h2 style="text-align: justify">Essential vitamins and minerals


<p style="text-align: justify">It might be difficult to eat a balanced diet while maintaining work-life balance, hence using good quality multi vitamins thrice a week will actually help you stay healthy. Take note that these are supplemental and not an alternative to your meals.


<h2 style="text-align: justify">In moderation only


<p style="text-align: justify">Coffee, tea and  dark chocolate show significant improvement in cognitive ability and increasing brain function.No wonder they have been so popular with busy people throught the decades. However, moderation must be exercised. Caffeine must be avoided after 3Pm, if you have sleep disturbances.

<p style="text-align: justify">The flavonoids in chocolate have been shown to improve blood flow to the brain in young and old alike.

In one study, a single dose of flavonol-rich cocoa increased blood flow to the brain in healthy, young adults.’’[(source: http://edition.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/12/20/health.chocolate/)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16794461)


## Importance of breakfast


Breakfast must be the heaviest meal of the day as it fuels you for the day ahead. After almost a 12 hour fast, it is most important to stack up your body with energy efficient foods like eggs, milk and cereal. You must not lose on this to have a productive and busy day.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Frequency of meals


<p style="text-align: left"><span style="text-align: justify">There is much debate on this topic considering different body types, sizes and habits, but the fact remains that if you want to be charged all through the day, having smaller meals every 2-3 hours works much better than 2 heavy meals all day (which will end up making yo</span>u feel dizzy instead). Timing is a big factor in boosting and maintaining good energy.

 Hi I am Aymeric, the founder of Week Plan. I have been personally involved in the process of rebranding and wanted to share how the process went. 

## Why?

 

When Week Plan started 6 years ago, I had no idea it would be become so popular and wouldn’t have guessed what types of users would use it. I’d pick the colors for the user interface based on personal preference rather than proper “strategy”.  

To help grow Week Plan I believe that the brand should connect better with the target audience. Today, we have students, busy parents, freelancers, entrepreneurs and managers but most of our paid users are entrepreneurs and managers. I wanted to refresh to brand to reflect that reality.  

## The process

 

I approached the branding agency [Folk](http://www.folk.com.au/) and asked if they’d want to help work on the new Week Plan. Folk is a top agency that works with big names in Australia including government agencies. I have worked with them in the past and I was very happy to have another opportunity.
 

### Design brief

 

The first step was to drive to express what I was trying to express through the brand. Week Plan is about prioritization and execution so I identified I wanted a brand that would be **bold**, **determined **and **focused**. I want Week Plan to be a movement of effective people and I want the logo to be so inspiring, people would want to be part of it.
 

While learning about brand identity, I found that you have brand archetypes (the Magician, the Ruler, the Lover…) to help group brands. For me, Week Plan is composed of the Hero archetype (courage), the Ruler (control) with a sprinkle of the Magician (vision).

### Candidates

 

After a little while, the Folk team came back with a list of candidates.

Logo 1 and 2: The stripes in the logos represent the multiple roles you have in life, or the chaos that ends in a single prioritized lane (the black tick). I really liked the meaning behind the logo.  

Logo 3: Logo 3 is solid and strong. The \ represents prioritization and the V represents the execution. They form the W of Week Plan. Simple. Added bonus: the company behind Week Plan is called Wise Labs, and it aims to help leaders and their teams align their actions with their vision. \ could represent alignment, and V the execution.  

Logo 4: I didn’t really consider logo 4 although it was surprisingly popular in the surveys I sent to my personal and professional networks.  

### Results

 

Once the logo was selected, I could pick a font that would match the values behind the brand. I loved the strength of **Fjalla One**.
 

This is how the new brand identity has been integrated in the existing websites:

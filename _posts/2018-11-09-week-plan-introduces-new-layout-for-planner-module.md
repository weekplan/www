Since day one, Week Plan has always been about making you — our valued customers —  more effective. 

Week Plan has gone through a lot of modifications with the goal of helping you work on the right things, instead of just doing things right.

That's why our engineers are working hard to deliver the best prioritization software there is for busy entrepreneurs, managers, professionals, and teams.

Following the re-launching of our mobile apps for [Android](https://weekplan.net/week-plan-releases-faster-android-app/) and [iOS](https://weekplan.net/introducing-the-new-week-plan-app-for-ios/), and after spending countless hours listening to your feedback, we've made some major changes to the layout of Week Plan.

## New Schedule Section for Weekly Planning

One of the major changes we introduced to version 2.127.3 is the **Schedule** section that now houses the planner. 

Previously, you only had the main **Planner** module for everything, including **High-Impact Tasks** and **Boards**. Now, we've added the **Schedule** section and removed the **High-Impact Tasks** and **Boards** (more on these later).

So why introduce the **Schedule** section and remove the **HITs** and **Boards**? Well, we want you to see all your tasks — in one view — without having to scroll down for other details such as your **High-Impact Tasks** and **Lists**. 

When you open the **Planner**, you'll easily get a clear view of what you need to accomplish.

Additionally, we made the timelines visible for the weekly and daily views. This way, you can clearly see the time of your tasks. 

Just drag your tasks to the timeline and voila!

## Plan of the Week Section for Your High Impact Tasks

We've added the **Plan of the Week** section (on the left side of the planner) to keep you focused on your **High-Impact Tasks**. 

In the previous layout, you had to scroll down on the planner to access your HITs. Not only was it time-consuming, it was also misleading.

Let me explain. We found out many users were using the HITs section as a backlog for their tasks for each of their roles. 

Remember that HITs are not ordinary tasks, but are more like milestones that will get you closer to your goals. 

That was the reason why we added the **Boards** section, which is the ideal place to store your ideas and park your tasks.

So why introduce the **Plan of the Week** section? It's simple — we want you to clearly visualize your Plan for the Week, which is what Week Plan is really about. 

The **Plan of the Week** merges all your HITs into one section that you can easily view and edit without the need to scroll down.

There are some minor quirks though, like the sorting isn't quite right. Even some users prefer having their HITs grouped by role. 

The new layout has a learning curve, too. 

If there's one thing we could have done better, it's educating our users about any changes we're making in Week Plan.

## Separate Boards Section for Your Ideas

We also removed the **Boards** section from the planner and moved it next to the **Schedule** section. So now you have two sections at the top — **Schedule** and **Boards**. 

Other than this layout change, the **Boards** section is still the same. You can use it as a backlog or a Kanban board with customizable lists for every role.

## **What About My Roles? A Solution That Might Work**

A note about the **Roles** feature. We received complaints about the new layout and its lack of visual emphasis on roles. 

Some users want to bring back the previous layout, which displayed your different roles and their corresponding HITs below the planner.

But after some careful consideration and brainstorming, we think it's more important that you have a **Plan of the Week** section for your HITs on the left side of the planner. 

We think the new layout closely matches the First Things First principle of Stephen Covey.

If you still want to have a backlog of tasks grouped by roles, there's a workaround you might want to try. 

You can use the **Boards** section to create Lists for your different roles. You can have the roles side by side (similar to the previous layout) using a board with lists for each role.

Here's an example:

## Still Planning: Separate Roles Section for Your Different Hats

We're very open to feedback. That's why we're considering the option to have a separate **Roles** section for your different hats.

This new section will display all your tasks per role. In other words, the **Roles** section will be a special place where you can keep track of your tasks for your roles.

## Lessons Learned From This Experience

We really value your feedback and support. So keep them coming. 

We're sorry if some of you were frustrated with the new layout. There are a lot of lessons to learn from this experience.

Here are some of our realizations:

* We need to improve our product development practices.
* We need to focus on solving problems rather than implementing suggestions from our users (too often, users want features, but we want to know what pain they want to solve with that feature).
* We need to get feedback from our users before developing the features.
* We need to show to our users the changes that are coming up so that it doesn't come as a surprise.
* We need tutorials and guides to accompany the changes

## Conclusion

We're on a quest to perfecting the one and only life planner that works. 

We aren't there yet. But with your feedback and support, we'll get to a state of unstoppable effectiveness.

Following up with our last weekâ€™s blog on [Be proactive: the best resources we found online](https://weekplan.net/7-habits-be-proactive/), we have enlisted a list of wonderful resources which can help you develop the second habit: Begin with an end in mind.<!--more-->

In the book, we see Stephen Covey starting the chapter by inviting us to visualise attending our own funeral and understand what we want our family, friends and colleagues to say about us. However, after visualizing this you might feel what is the need for us to do this and what will happen if we wont?


## Understanding what the habit is about


Wayne W. Dyer is often quoted for this:


>Begin with the end in mind. Start with end outcome and work backwards to make your dream possible


Stephen Covey himself has explained this need as a process to validate if the steps taken by us are in the right direction and as per our ultimate objective.


>There is no point driving a fast car if you are heading to the wrong direction.


You can see him talk about the habit in the following two videos:


### Part A: The mental creation

### Part B: Creating a life center

Another video which defines the purpose of this habit is Start With The End in Mind by Isaiah Hankel, author of The Emotionally Intelligent Leader. Watch him explained the need and impact of this habit:

## Finding your life purpose


However, this habit also creates a need to draft a vision and mission for oneself as we all work hard for objectives like promotions, higher income and more recognition but never understand if these things really matter.
To draft a vision for oneself/family/team check out these interesting takes on how to start with in a flash.

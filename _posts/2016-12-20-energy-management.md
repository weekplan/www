<span style="font-weight: 400;">Success does not come easy. At times an individual cannot figure out reasons for lack of success even after allocating sufficient time for his work. There is one missing ingredient to the mix and that is: Full potential.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to figure out how the work translates into concentration and focus complications. Any lack of attention can affect your work in the long run. Constant hours at the office can take a toll on your mental as well as physical well- being. Unless your body and mind are not happy, you cannot be a 100% productive at work or any instance in life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are 6 ways to manage your energy and reach highest potential from yourself.</span><!--more-->


## **Quality sleep**


<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is any stresses or discomfort in the body, sleep will help. However, the idea of optimum sleep is different. You must sleep 7-8 hours, not more, not less. If at work you feel sleepy for no reason, there must be definite problem that you need to address. Not being able to sleep at night properly goes a long way fiddling with your productivity in a stealthy way. Try to figure the reason for staying up, sometimes even as simple as an active mind can make it really hard to sleep. Use earplugs and eye masks to avoid environmental disruptions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The night routine must be well-thought of. Radiations from electronics like our phone and television actually hampers circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. Completely remove exposure to electronics at least half hour before going to sleep.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">**Emotional Energy**</span>


<span style="font-weight: 400;">Motivation is always a big factor to achieve or work towards anything. One part of your life will seep into the other. If there is something troubling you, get to the bottom of it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to get anything done if you don't feel like doing it. Depression can on-set in a very stealthly way and you might not be able to tell the difference. Ask your friends, family and co-workers if they have felt a change in your behaviour lately. Lack of motivation can also just be your body being a victim of a sedentary lifestyle. Make time for physical activities and options like yoga, mindfulness and mediation, and see if it helps your energy at work. If the problem persists (do not count laziness here), consult a doctor or a therapist to understand why this lethargic behavior exists.</span>


## <span style="font-weight: 400;">**Bad eating habits**</span>


<span style="font-weight: 400;">You are what you eat is wisely said. There can be underlying deficiencies resulting in lethargy and malaise. Certain foods which aren’t part of our diet are essential to proper body and mental function. You might be missing many elements from your diet. Give attention to almonds, fish-oils (omega-3 fatty acids). Learn how to manage your blood sugar and optimize your diet for something that suits your energy needs. </span><a href="http://weekplan.net/energy-boost/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential foods and how to follow a diet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> must be high priority.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">**Lack of exercise**</span>


<span style="font-weight: 400;">People who exercise tend to have more energy and sleep better. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Take care of your body and it will take care of your mind.  A sedentary lifestyle can take a toll on your physical health which can in turn affect your work performance. Mediation, Exercise, and playing a sport will induce strength as well as vitality both mentally and physically. Even a 3 km sprint in a day can significantly make a change in your body’s processes and metabolism. Physical exercise is the only way to flush out toxins and release your body of some stresses that you encompass at work. </span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">**Insufficient re-creation**</span>


<span style="font-weight: 400;">People who are overworked tend to overlook</span><a href="http://weekplan.net/how-a-user-of-weekplan-keeps-his-focus-sharp-all-day-long/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the importance of proper rest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Checking your Facebook or emails is not proper re-creation. Try to make taking regular rests part of your working day.  Make sure you get up every 45 mins from your workstation (it could be as little as going to the water cooler and taking a sip) . It has been researched that the brain works better this way instead of just sitting glued to the seat whether it is for a creative or mathematical output you require.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most successful people have strict routines and prioritize on their health and well-being. Taking care of yourself is the first step you have towards achieving your goal. If you know how your energy works for you, you can make anything work for yourself.</span>

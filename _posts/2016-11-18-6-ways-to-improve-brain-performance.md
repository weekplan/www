Making time and effort to keep a healthy brain leads to a happier and productive life. Here are some effective ways to increase brain health and memory.<!--more-->


## Challenge your brain

Get mental stimulation. Every part of our body, including the brain needs exercise. Keep yourself busy with mental games, puzzles, reading, math problems and recall. Best idea would be engrossing yourself with activities which require dexterity like drawing, painting, playing music, sports. These help stimulate your brain and create new brain cells. Utilizing both mind and body will help you be motivated, **increase attention and concentration**.

## Physical Exercise

**Increasing the blood flow** throughout the body is a straight ticket to a healthy mind. You can avoid ‘brain fog’ that comes with age if you regularly **hit the gym or cardio**. Researchers from University of British Columbia found that regular exercise boosts the size of your hippo-campus, the area of the brain involved in verbal memory and learning. This is however, only valid for cardio and blood pumping exercises rather than resistance training, muscle toning and body building exercises. Moderate intensity exercises like swimming, tennis, squash and dancing are some perfect examples.

## Brain boosting diet

Food is really underappreciated when it comes to brain development and health. Constant flow of vitamins, minerals, fatty acids and minerals go a long way in creating that [perfect functioning](http://weekplan.net/energy-boost/) of the brain. Some super brain foods you must start with right now are Avocados, Blueberries, Fish (especially Salmon) , Eggs, Spinach, Walnuts( the kings in this department)

A reduced caloric intake has been seen as directly proportional to a lower risk of mental decline in old age. Vitamins like  Folic acid, B6, and B12 help lower your homocysteine levels, high levels of which have been linked to an increased risk of dementia. So [eat smart](http://weekplan.net/energy-boost/) and stay smart.

## Quality sleep

A clear rested brain has more benefits than we think. Don’t take it the wrong way, proper sleep means optimum number of hours every night which is 7-8 hours. Less would be bad for health and oversleeping is even worse. If you get optimum sleep be sure you will be able to make clearer decisions, gather and organize memories, increase creativity, increase motor performance and clear out toxins. Don’t ‘work hard’ to the point where you tire yourself and reduce your **brain power and capacity**.

**Meditation** (In turn **avoiding / managing stress)** 

Stress and anxiety is like a constant pressure on your brain. Some ‘healthy’ stress might be important for motivation but it can cause adrenal fatigue, affect memory, make you age faster and create mental and mood issues. To avoid it, best hack is to practice breathing techniques when stress strikes. 

Meditation for half hour per day would also significantly <a href="http://weekplan.net/how-to-spend-the-first-hour-of-your-day/">**reduce stress levels**</a> in your body. For some physical exercise is a must to reduce this, so recognize your call (that’s the reason yoga combines mental and physical exercise) . Find ways to express this extra stress by a workout in the morning, making time for meditation and yoga if you find yourself low on energy. 

Although production of [cortisol](http://weekplan.net/the-comprehensive-guide-about-body-language-cortisol-impact-of-high-power-postures/) (the stress hormone) is important from an evolutionary perspective, the present sedentary lifestyle suffe
rs with this. 

You must use meditation as to increase your brain’s capacity to focus when YOU have to focus. This is learning control on your brain, hence giving you the power to work on your highest capacity when you need to. Distraction levels in people have increased to paramount quantities and it is important to slow down in this social media driven, competitive, neck-to-neck world and come out strong. That is the new frontier of survival of the fittest.

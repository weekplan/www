Time management is a challenge even for the most talented and motivated people.

Productivity levels vary from day to day, and modern tools that are supposed to help us work better and faster can turn against us – think of all the time you lose checking your email every day or giving up to guilty pleasures like shopping online.

[Week Plan](http://weekplan.net) should help you focus on your most important tasks instead of showing you how much work you still need to do in a short time. Here are 5 reasons why a weekly planner will help you get things done and enjoy your daily activities more:


* You can keep track of all responsibilities at any moment

A weekly planner can be accessed from any device, including your smartphone, and you can always check upcoming tasks without needing to carry your agenda with you. Do you feel like updating your schedule while commuting to work? No problem, you can have a look at all your tasks right now!

* You get used to focusing on important activities

Do you feel like any activity on your schedule is urgent? It’s a common feeling, and this happens when you forget to prioritize activities by importance. A good weekly planner will allow you to showcase the most important activities, keep track of them and avoid running out of time because of poor task prioritizing.

* You can share your schedule with other people

Explaining your daily plans to other people is not only annoying, but also time consuming. The best weekly planners include team features, allowing your family, friends or co-workers to have access to your schedule or a part of it (in case you need privacy) and making it easier to find a moment when you can spend time with them or work together.

* You’ll increase your productivity

According to some grim statistics, only 45% of the time people spend at work is actually used for completing primary job duties. A reminder from your weekly planner and the perspective of not finishing your to-do list today will help stop wasting time.

* You’ll enjoy a feeling of completion at the end of the week

Each time you cross out an activity in your weekly planner or mark it as complete, you’ll feel closer to attaining your goals and at peace with your inner self. It’s a well-known fact: you enjoy your leisure time more when you know you’ve done your job!

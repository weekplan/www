We’re starting a new series where we interview highly effective people to their insights on the subjects of leadership, productivity, management, personal development, and success.

In the first episode, Week Plan Founder Aymeric Gaurat Apelli is interviewing an old friend and a fellow entrepreneur who created popular games like Vikings Gone Wild, Heroes of Paragon, and the Chronicles of Crime, which raised nearly $800,000 on Kickstarter.

Meet [Vincent Vergonjeanne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentv/). He’s a highly successful game designer and CEO of [Lucky Duck Games](https://luckyduckgames.com/), [Kobojo](http://www.kobojo.com/), and [EverydayiPlay](https://everydayiplay.com/). His games have been played by millions of users around the world across all devices.

I asked Vincent to share his thoughts on charisma and leadership — two areas, among others, in which he’s extremely good at. He also shares some tips and tricks for hiring people, caring for your team, and keeping customers engaged.

## On the Importance of Knowing Yourself 

Vincent shares his experience leading a large team at Kobojo. He knew he was effective in running a smaller team that had 30 people. But as the company grew to 90 employees, he became unhappy and started to struggle. He realized that no matter how much charisma he had, it simply didn't scale with 90 people.

## On Having a Company Culture, Mission, and Values

One of the reasons why Kobojo struggled was that it didn’t have a company culture, says   Vergonjeanne, it is the foundation. Company culture is not something you can put after; it’s the first step. He also believes that it’s important to communicate the mission and values of the company.

## On Communicating the Vision

Everything rises and falls in leadership. You have to believe in the mission. Don’t treat your mission like it’s a bullshit poster from HR. In communicating your vision, conduct regular meetings and be transparent about everything.

## On Dealing with Hardships

Hardships are part of life’s journey, he said, it’s part of any company’s journey. You need to embrace them upfront and you need to have a very strong strategy to move forward.

## On Staying Sharp and Focused

The great Stephen Covey said you need to sharpen your saw. Vincent says you need to stay sharp, you need to stay focused, and you need to be critical because you’re working on a shared dream. Vincent also recommends reading a lot of books to help you grow as a leader. He mentions books like the One Minute Manager, Tribal Leadership, and Theory of Fun as his favorites.

## On Making Things Fun for Your Team (Theory of Fun)

It’s important to make the job fun so your team doesn’t get bored, he adds. Constantly renew challenges for your team by encouraging them to learn new things that can help them grow. Support them in learning new stuff. Vincent shares how he encouraged one of his employees to learn programming by giving him resources and a 1-week lesson on how to code. That employee ended up writing a program for the company later.

> The key is growth. Personal growth is the key to keep people motivated and it shows that you care. It shows that they aren't just not here to execute the task of the boss.

## On Growing Leaders

Finally, Vincent talks about growing leaders in your company. He believes there’s just 1 word for it — reciprocity. If you care for someone, they will care for you, he said. If your job is to build a product, then the best leadership is to care for the people who will build a product, he added. It creates synergy. But he also warns that caring doesn’t mean you’re nice to your employees all the time.

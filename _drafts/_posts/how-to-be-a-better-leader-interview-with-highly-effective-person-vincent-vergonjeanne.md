We’re starting a new series where we interview highly effective people to their insights on the subjects of leadership, productivity, management, personal development, and success.

In the first episode, Week Plan Founder Aymeric Gaurat Apelli is interviewing an old friend and a fellow entrepreneur who created popular games like Vikings Gone Wild, Heroes of Paragon, and the Chronicles of Crime, which raised nearly $800,000 on Kickstarter.

Meet [Vincent Vergonjeanne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentv/). He’s a highly successful game designer and CEO of [Lucky Duck Games](https://luckyduckgames.com/), [Kobojo](http://www.kobojo.com/), and [EverydayiPlay](https://everydayiplay.com/). His games have been played by millions of users around the world across all devices.

I asked Vincent to share his thoughts on charisma and leadership — two areas, among others, in which he’s extremely good at. He also shares some tips and tricks for hiring people, caring for your team, and keeping customers engaged.

## On the Importance of Knowing Yourself 

Vincent shares his experience leading a large team at Kobojo. He knew he was effective in running a smaller team that had 30 people. But as the company grew to 90 employees, he became unhappy and started to struggle. He realized that no matter how much charisma he had, it simply didn't scale with 90 people.

## On Having a Company Culture, Mission, and Values

One of the reasons why Kobojo struggled was that it didn’t have a company culture, says   Vergonjeanne, it is the foundation. Company culture is not something you can put after; it’s the first step. He also believes that it’s important to communicate the mission and values of the company.

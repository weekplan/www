Tony is lucky. He has everything — a successful career, a high-paying job, a wonderful family, a fancy car, a big house. The list goes on. 

Meanwhile, Roger isn’t doing very well at work. Even worse, his marriage is failing. He’s super stressed out and he fears for his future. 

Why are some people more successful than others? Why are some people achieving more while others are stuck in a rut? Are some people just lucky? 

We constantly play these conversations and questions in our heads. We’re often tempted to think that lucky people like Tony are highly favored by the gods. 

What is Tony’s secret? 

## **The Truth About Luck**

Ray Kroc, the man who brought McDonald’s to the world, didn’t believe in luck. 

He spent a lot of years working as a salesman before finding the McDonald brothers. It’s easy to think that Ray got lucky because he met the brothers. 

But Kroc worked extremely hard to open hundreds of McDonald’s branches across the US. The McDonald brothers didn’t have the vision, but he had it. 

And the rest was history. 

> “Luck is a dividend of sweat. The more you sweat, the luckier you get.” - Ray Kroc

Ray Kroc increased his luck by working hard and by thinking smarter. 

This means that luck is simply the result of your actions. In other words, you can be lucky by adopting the effective habits of highly successful people.

## **Tilting the Odds in Your Favor**

Dr. Richard Wiseman, author of the book titled “The Luck Factor”, said that people aren’t born lucky or unlucky, and that in order to have good luck, you need to have the right attitude. 

Wiseman conducted intensive interviews and experiments with over 400 volunteers. After 10 years of studying what makes other people lucky, he concluded that luck is something that can be learned. 

> “Lucky people just try stuff. Unlucky people suffered from paralysis by analysis. They wouldn’t do anything until they walked through every single angle and by then the world had moved on. They don’t gain the benefits of learning through doing. I’m a big fan of starting small, trying lots of projects, seeing what works and what doesn’t, and iterating based on feedback.” - Richard Wiseman.

The truth is you can increase your luck by learning the habits of successful people. 

You can improve your “luck score” by following the steps that they took to achieve effectiveness in all areas of their life. 

Here are some ways to tilt the odds in your favor.

## **24 Ways to Increase Your Luck**

### **1. Believe That You’re Lucky**

The first step is to believe you’re lucky. As strange as it sounds, but believing that you’re lucky makes you more likely to be receptive to the opportunities around you. 

Believing that you’re lucky changes your perspective. 

Having a lucky mindset requires cultivating positive thoughts. Be positive and block any negative thoughts.

### **2. Expect to Win**

When you expect to win, you’re motivated to pursue anything. 

For example, if you’re applying for a job, think that you already got hired. You’ll feel confident and you’ll perform well during the interview, increasing your chances of actually getting hired. 

Lucky people expect the best so they attract the best. 

Unlucky people, on the other hand, are somewhat negative, so they miss the opportunities in front of them. 

### **3. Be Clear About Your Goals**

Lucky people have clear, written goals. If you’ll ask them what their goals are, they can articulately tell you about them.

They keep their goals handy too, perhaps scribbled in a notebook or stored in a tool like Week Plan. 

The point is, write your goals and make sure they’re accessible so can you read them every day. You’ll be surprised how useful this habit is.

### **4. Be Audacious With Your Goals**

Now that you’ve written your goals, it’s time to be loud about them. 

It doesn’t mean shouting out your goals. Rather, it means vocally communicating your goals to your wife or husband, your friends or colleagues. 

By being audacious with your goals, you’ll trigger opportunities faster than ever. 

### **5. Practice Visualization**

For starters, visualization is imagining yourself achieving what you want. 

It’s beginning with the end in mind, forcing yourself to picture out the ideal outcomes of any task or situation. 

When you practice visualization, your brain releases dopamine to boost mood and motivation.

The truth is your brain can’t tell the difference between fantasy and reality. So when you’re visualizing your ideal future, your brain excretes the same chemicals that it would normally release when you’re experiencing real success.

Picture yourself winning in all areas of your life and you’ll notice your energy levels and mood go up. 

### **6. Make Daily Affirmations a Habit**

Lucky people make daily affirmations a habit. To affirm means to acknowledge that you’re lucky and that you’re going to be successful.

Affirmations are the seeds of success that you can plant into your subconscious. 

Talk to yourself in front of the mirror and tell yourself that you’re achieving your goals. Repeat this process every day.

Just remember that affirmations are positive and said in the first person, and in the present tense. 

### **7. Trust Your Gut**

Learn to trust your intuition. Intuition is a gut feeling. 

Lucky people — those who are highly successful — have strong intuition, and they listen to it. 

Intuition can help you make long-term decisions that will benefit you in the long run. More importantly, it helps you avoid bad decisions. 

You can hone your intuition through meditation. If you spend some quiet time during the day, you’re more likely to listen to your gut feeling. 

About 90% of lucky people trust their intuition.

### **8. Work Hard**

It’s not a secret that lucky people work hard. The key is they work hard — quietly. 

They don’t boast. They don’t talk about their achievements that much. They just work.

People will only see their successes, so they’re often perceived as simply lucky. But deep down, their work ethic is uncanny. 

Be a hustler and work hard — they are sure ways to get lucky. 

### **8. Be Open to Opportunities**

Lucky people are always on the lookout for new opportunities. They easily recognize them because they believe that they’re lucky.  

Whether it’s the promotion that you’ve been waiting for, or the chance to land your dream job, anticipate those opportunities. And be willing to accept them. 

### **10. Maximize Opportunities**

One of the benefits of having a positive attitude is you’re able to easily identify opportunities that are in front of you.

But it’s one thing to seize an opportunity, and it’s another to maximize it. Lucky people know how to maximize opportunities. 

Whether it’s pitching your side business to a potential investor or promoting your other products to customers, learn to make the most of your opportunities.

### **11. Leverage Failure**

You may not believe it, but lucky people and unlucky people have the same amount of good luck and bad luck. Sounds crazy? 

The difference is lucky people know how to bounce back and use their misfortunes in their favor. 

So learn from your failures and remember that bad luck — failures, mistakes, misfortunes — are temporary. 

### **12. Know The Right People**

Lucky people know the right people. They connect with other people who can help them achieve success. 

Look for mentors and learn everything that you can from them. 

Your circle of friends defines who you truly are. Surround yourself with successful people to increase your luck. 

Avoid negative people. They can do more harm than good. 

### **13. A Little Feng Shui Won’t Hurt**

Have you heard of Feng Shui? 

It’s an ancient Chinese practice that focuses on attracting good luck, fortune, success, good health. 

While others are skeptical that it’ll work, it’s actually an established concept in the East and countless people believe that it works. 

Try “googling” for the best Feng Shui practices and start implementing a few of them. 

Who knows, maybe it’ll increase your luck. 

### **14. Release Good Karma**

In addition to Feng Shui, consider releasing some good karma. 

Karma is deeply rooted in Hindu philosophy and believes that what you do to others will also happen to you.

So if you do good to other people, the same good will happen to you. 

Think of it as increasing your “luck score”.

### **15. Try Prayer**

If you believe in a god or in a higher power, then consider prayer. Some say that praying helps them believe that their dreams will be answered.

Prayer is definitely a good way to increase your luck. Countless successful people can attest to the power of prayer. 

### **16. Don’t Worry Too Much**

Forget the past. Don’t worry about the future. And focus on the present. 

Lucky people focus on the now and hope for a brighter tomorrow. 

What worries you, masters you. So stop worrying. 

### **17. Escape Overthinking**

We’re easily tempted to overthink situations in our lives. But overthinking can be taxing. 

It drains your energy, keeps your spirits down, and dampens your untapped potential. 

Don’t overthink everything that happens to you. Move on and keep going. 

### **18. Harness Gratitude**

Lucky people are thankful. They know that everything happens for a reason. They believe in good luck. 

And they know that good luck can happen to anyone who believes in it. So they’re grateful.

Practice gratitude by being thankful for everything that you have in your life — a job that pays the bills, a loving family that brings joy to your heart, a friend that makes you laugh.

### **19. Serve Others**

Interestingly, lucky people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg have given away their massive fortunes to charities and non-profit organizations. They also devote time and money to build foundations for the poor. In the process, they increase their luck.

Start serving others by participating in outreach programs and doing some volunteer work. If you have the capacity, organize your friends and colleagues to serve your neighborhood. 

### **20. Relax**

Dr. Wiseman says that lucky people are more calm and relaxed. 

“Lucky people are skilled at creating, noticing and acting upon chance opportunities,” said Wiseman. “They do this in various ways, including networking, adopting a relaxed attitude to life and by being open to new experiences.”

So sit back and relax.

### **21. Try New Things**

If you want to increase your luck, you need to try new ways of achieving what you want, especially if your current strategy isn’t working.

Lucky people try new things to achieve their goals. They don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. 

Know what’s working for you and if your strategy isn’t working, try a better strategy. 

The great Tony Robbins recommends adopting new actions if you aren’t getting any results. 

### **22. Take Calculated Risks**

Successful people didn’t succeed because they’re lucky. They succeeded because they took calculated risks.

Jeff Bezos risked his high-profile career in Wall Street to build a company that sells books on the internet. Elon Musk spent most of his money on electric cars and spaceships.

Lucky people take calculated risks and make tough decisions.

### **23. Be Proactive**

Take responsibility for your life. Stephen Covey exhorts us to be proactive. 

Take charge of your life and stop blaming other people for your poverty, misfortune, failures. 

By being proactive — instead of reactive — you stop the blame and you reclaim your own power to change your life. 

### **24. Take Action**

Action is the foundation of all successes. 

If you don’t execute your goals and plans, it’ll result in nothing. Procrastination equals poverty. 

Lucky people — those who are successful in life — take massive action. A man of action is favored by the goddess of good luck.

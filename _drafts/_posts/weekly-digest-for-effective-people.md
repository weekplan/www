A new research suggests motivation isn’t the key to achieving your goals. The British Journal of Health Psychology measured how frequently people exercised over a 2-week period. 

It found that those who wrote down exactly when and where they intended to exercise were most likely to follow through. 

Motivation had no significant effects on exercise behavior. But having a plan for implementation is the key.  

This is why [Week Plan](https://weekplan.net/) asks you to schedule your high impact tasks.

It works by imagining your desired future and then reflecting on your present reality. But the trick is to identify the things that are stopping you from achieving that future. 

Mental contrasting helps you save time,  conserve energy, eliminate distractions, and focus on your most important goals.

Weiss believes that the most important question to ask yourself is “What kind of person do I want to be?”

He also shares 3 qualities that prevent people from becoming better versions of themselves.

“Becoming the best version of yourself requires more than sculpted muscles, waxed chests, and whitened teeth. It requires intellectual enrichment, empathy, sacrifice for others, and the most important quality of all: kindness,” he adds.

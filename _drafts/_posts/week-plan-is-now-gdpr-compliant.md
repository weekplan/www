What’s New in Week Plan Version 2.109.1

Week Plan is Now GDPR Compliant

- Week Plan is committed to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We’ve added a new page that asks for your acceptance of our terms and privacy policy. 

Removed Theme Option

- We’ve removed the theme option to make the overall experience simpler, without the fuss, so you can focus on what matters. 

Removed Onboarding Pages and Introduce Induction Pages

- We’ve also removed the onboarding pages and introduced Induction Pages. These new pages are blah blah blah. 

Removed Username From Registration Page

In the spirit of GDPR, we’re no longer requiring you to enter a username on the registration page.

More Updates and Features

-Left Menu: Renamed “Schedule” to “Planner”.

-Removed default role “Self”.

-Planner: Show timeline only when a task is dragged over a list or if there are events in the day.

-Move roles (and list) quick actions (Edit, Delete) into the top right menu

Role-List: Don’t Show HITs That Are Scheduled 

-When all high impact tasks (HITs) in a role have been scheduled, we show a nice green tick and a grey text that says “All HITs have been scheduled.”

-A task can be on both a list and date.

Bug Fixes:

-New User: Can’t login with Microsoft Outlook

-Can’t assign role to task.

## New Video Tutorial on Using Goals

Following the latest update to the **Goals** module that allows you to expand your goals all at once to display your high impact tasks, we’ve now added a video tutorial that clearly explains how to use the **Goals** module. Have a look!

## Reorganized Edit Task Module

We’ve reorganized the **Edit Task** module so it’s easier for you to use and understand Week Plan’s awesome features. 

You now have a **Scheduling** section for the calendar, duration settings, repetition settings, and reminders. 

Underneath it is the **Attributes** section, where you can assign roles, mark tasks as **Important** or **Urgent**, and view the time tracker.

## Security Against CSRF Attacks

Your privacy and security is our top priority, so we’ve made Week Plan more secure by making it impenetrable against CSRF attacks. 

While we can’t reveal the steps that our developers took to achieve this, you can sleep well at night knowing that your data is safe.

## Fixed Redirecting Issue in Firefox

Some of our users were experiencing redirecting issues while using Week Plan on a Firefox browser. 

We are happy to announce that we’ve fixed the reported redirecting issues. 

So using Week Plan on Firefox should be as smooth as butter.

## Merged Notes and Comments

We’ve also merged the **Notes** and **Comments** sections so it’s easier for you to access them without having to click multiple times. 

You can now view them in one place. Previously, they were in separate tabs. 

The result is an intuitive, cleaner **Edit Task** module.

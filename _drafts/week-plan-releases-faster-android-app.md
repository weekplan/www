In addition to Week Plan's new OKRs module, we're also announcing a faster Android app today. We've made the decision to store files on the device so that the app loads faster without consuming more data. 

Simply put, our engineers have managed to include your files in the application package instead of being loaded on the fly. This means you'll have a faster, seamless experience on your Android device. 

The update is available to download for all Android devices starting today. Head over to the [Google Play store to download the update](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.wiselabs.WeekPlan&hl=en).

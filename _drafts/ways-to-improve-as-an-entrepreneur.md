We’ve all had those days when we're so tired with our desk jobs that we stop and think about how fun it would have been if you were Bill Gates. 

I always thought that if I were the founder of the world’s top software company, I’d be on a 24/7 vacation, reading the best books and travelling to the best places around the world. 

But years later, as I ventured to entrepreneurship myself, I realized Bill Gates wouldn’t really be the 24’7 vacationing type. 

Know why I think so? 

# The Anatomy of an Entrepreneur

For starters, entrepreneurs are those who venture into businesses. They are people who chose to put their fate in their own hands — those who chose to take risks. 

You see, being an entrepreneur is not a walk in the park. It takes time and dedication to be successful and I don’t think lying in your bed all day would suffice. 

On the other hand, being an entrepreneur is more than just venturing into business. It’s also about making that business successful and sustainable. 

Entrepreneurship is about having the right mindset, motivation, and endless drive to push forward and challenge limits. This is why being an entrepreneur is so hard. 

# 5 Struggles That Entrepreneurs Face

More than financial freedom, one thing that entices people to become entrepreneurs is the freedom from office politics. Entrepreneurs love being able to work on their own terms. 

But venturing into a business is not that easy. Most entrepreneurs experience certain problems, such as the following:

1. Insufficient Capital

   Starting a business requires budget, but some choose to go on with their venture without enough funds. This can be a problem in the long run. As much as possible, make sure to acquire sufficient capital for your business. 
2. Lack of Knowledge

   Some see business ventures as a railway for instant success. This drives them into impulse decisions without the right knowledge, experience or resources, without knowing what they’re getting into. 
3. No Stable Paycheck. 

   Entrepreneurs enjoy working their own hours because they’re the boss. But the downside is that they don’t have a stable paycheck, especially in the early stages of their businesses. It can be disheartening and stressful, but all entrepreneurs go through this process. 
4. Loneliness

   Entrepreneurship is a lonely road, unless you’re starting a company with a partner. You’re on your own. You have to work hard alone and make tough decisions by yourself. It’s the price that you pay for building your own empire.
5. Always On the Grind

   The irony of entrepreneurship is that it requires more hard work compared to, say, a day job. Because you’re starting from scratch, you have the tendency to overwork yourself to the point of burning out. Work-life balance is a struggle, too.

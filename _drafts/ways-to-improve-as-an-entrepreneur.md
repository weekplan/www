Ways to improve as an entrepreneur

We’ve all had those days when were so tired with our desk jobs, so we stop and think how fun it might have been if you were Bill Gates. I always thought if I were him, I’d be on a 24’7 vacation, sleep all I want and eat everything I wanted.  But years later, as I ventured to entrepreneurship myself, I realized Bill Gates wouldn’t really be the 24’7 vacationing type. 

Know why I think so? 

For starters, entrepreneurs are those who venture into businesses. They are people who chose to put their fate in their own hands, those who chose to take risks. You see, being an entrepreneur is not a walk in the park, it takes time and dedication to be successful and I don’t think lying in your bed all day would suffice. On the other hand, being an entrepreneur is more than just venturing into business, it’s also about making that business successful. It about having the right mindset and motivation, an endless drive to push forward and believing you can.

Aside from financial freedom, one thing that entices people to become entrepreneurs is being independent from management and being able to control their own time. But venturing into a business is not that easy, most entrepreneurs experience certain problems, such as:

1\.     Insufficient Capital

Starting a business requires budget but some choose to go on with their venture without enough funds. This can be a problem in the long run especially on the company’s sustainability. As much as possible, make sure to acquire sufficient capital for your business. 

2\.     Lack of knowledge

Some see business ventures as a railway for instant success; this drives them into impulse decisions without the right knowledge, experience or resources, without knowing what they’re getting into. There are several aspects in businesses where some entrepreneurs lack knowledge in, such as:

·      Finance Management

Even with enough capital, starting a business is still a challenge. Money is limited and if not handled correctly can run out. Most people start a company through bootstrapping, thus should be keen on everything money related even with his or her own expenses.

·      Building a team

Knowing when and who to hire is very crucial when building a company. The people you hire would be the people who will help you, so remember to be keen in choosing the right people.

·      Marketing Strategy

An effective marketing strategy can pave your way to a successful business.  The problem with some entrepreneurs is they rely too much on their products and forget how to deliver these products to the target market. 

 

·      Wire your brain

There are various reasons why people become entrepreneurs, but venturing into a business is not just about putting up a company. It’s also about making it successful, and this involves time, money, effort and dedication. This can be very challenging for most so when you decide to be an entrepreneur, remember to have the right mindset. Wire your brain to be stronger for all the challenges you may encounter. 

·      Always ask questions

You can never know enough. Right the point, when you’ve chosen to become an entrepreneur, you’ve listed yourself for a lifetime of endless learning. Remember that your business needs to cope up with demands and changes in the society. With that in mind, learn to always ask questions, know the latest trends, learn from anyone and everyone and use the things you learned and apply it to your company.

·      Smart time Management

We would usually love another 10 minutes in bed in the morning, wouldn’t we? Well, I’m sorry to tell you, that’s not how successful businessmen do it, because they manage their time wisely. Get an alarm clock, and get up when it rings. Use your time to plan, build new ideas, develop strategies and come up with innovations. Always use your time wisely.

·      Get involved

Surround yourself with fellow entrepreneurs; listen to their own venture stories and learn from them. You all have your own knowledge about business, share yours and learn from them in return. Get yourself a mentor from those who are veterans in the field, listen to how they did it, and remember if they can, so can you!

·      Widen your network

As an entrepreneur, it is important to widen your network. Meet people whom you can learn from, learn to attend event or gatherings, and join forums and discussions. Aside from fellow entrepreneurs, widening your network also applies to reaching out to your brands’ audience. Reach out to people who would purchase your products, and one effective way is by using the power of the internet. Use social media as a marketing essential. Let people know your brand and expand through it. 

·      Hone your communication skills

Your ability is usually showcased along with how you communicate well with the people around you. It takes a good talker to be a good businessman. Learn to be your own endorser, learn to impress with the way you talk. This can prove to be very important because a business is anchored on the people and their needs; learn to catch the hearts of your audience with just your words. 

·      Learn how to manage finances

Starting a business can be a little gruesome for some. Profit from your company doesn’t really come over night, that’s why learning to manage your finances is a very important matter. It would always seem that your funds wouldn’t be enough to bring your company to its full potential, so be frugal about it. Learn to know where and when to spend. Think about everything twice and avoid impulse spending.

·      Know your people

Your company would be made up of people who will work for you and be an integral part of your success. It is important to know them, listen to them, learn from them and be a leader for them at the same time. Observe effective company culture and know how to lead your people into your desired goal. 

·      Keep your eyes and mind open

Businesses strive hard to keep up with the peoples’ demands so always keep your eyes open for the latest trends. This should also be observed in cross investments, keep your mind open for possible product breakthroughs in the future.

·      Never back down from any challenges

Going into a business, never forget the risks. It wouldn’t really always turn out the way you want it to. There would be times of challenges, learn to always fight back and learn from them. These challenges would be honing you further, teach you a more how to bring your business to the top, and stay there.

            

Whatever your reason maybe to decide to be an entrepreneur, remember deciding to be one is a risk itself. Remember to be brave, keep an open mind and believe in yourself.

Be your own master!

You are in crisis mode when you feel overwhelmed by all your commitments, when everything seems important and urgent.
You probably are showing some signs of stress and the quality of your relationships and work are starting to deteriorate.

It sucks.

As the founder of Week Plan, daily I get contacted by people who are in crisis mode. I will write down in this article some tactics on how to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.

## How did we get here?

Let me tell you the bad news: you are likely responsible for the current situation. 

Whether you didn't say No when you should have or whether you willingly took too much to chew on, it is likely that your behaviour brought you to this situation and fixing the current situation without changing the underlying behaviour will not prevent the situation to come back.

I might write another article about how to set yourself to never get back into crisis mode but this article is solely focused on getting out of it as quickly as possible.

## The bucket analogy

Let's imagine that the total quantity of commitments you can comfortably work on at a given time is represented by a bucket. "Comfortably" means that you wouldn't incur negative stress and you would be able to deliver excellent results.

Now, in crisis mode, your bucket is overflowing.

To get out of this, you need to stop adding more to the bucket, and find ways to empty the bucket.

## Say 'No' beyond what you are comfortable with

Chances are you haven't said 'No' often enough and you are now in crisis mode. The first step is stop adding any more commitments to your already overflowing bucket.

You need to start rejecting what comes your way. 

Saying 'No' doesn't have to be confrontational. Generally, if you reject a request and explain you are already genuinely stressed and overcommitted people will understand. Saying 'No' will hurt them less than you delivering poor results or no result at all.

## Break promises

This one is controversial. We are trying to build integrity and keeping promises is critical. Promises to ourselves and promises to others. Keeping promises is also one way to build trust.

Yet, knowing how about a promise is, I suggest you break some of your less important promises. 

It will cause some level of pain. It will hurt your relationships but you are already in crisis mode, and you are going to hurt your relationships more down the road if you keep at it.

It is better to have no one on a job, than have someone who will perform poorly. Alternatively they can find a replacement.

It is likely some of your promises and commitments you have made are not that important to you or to the person you committed to. These should be your first candidates.

Breaking promises will help offload your bucket instantly, and the changes you will make in your productivity system and behaviour will prevent you from ever having to do it again.

## Brain dump

Some of the anxiety you are experiencing might come from tasks you can't do anything about right now and yet your mind keeps worrying about them.

This is wasteful and you don't need anymore anxiety.

I suggest doing the brain dump taught in the book "Getting Things Done". The brain dump is simple yet powerful in that it will instantly reduce your stress and give you some clarity.

Instead of keeping everything you have to do in your head, take an hour or two to write down every commitments, promises, tasks you have or may have to do.

I have written about [braindumps](/online-course-time-management/braindumps-how-to-reduce-stress-instantly/) in the emails we send to our Week Plan users, they are available online for convenience.

## Replace time wasters with re-creational activities

The hyphen character is intentional.

TV, social media, video games offer very little re-creational value. They don't help replenish your clarity of thought and energy levels.

Consider replacing with activities that make you feel really good:

- Some sort of relaxing activity: meditation (Headspace app is awesome), yoga, ice baths, cold showers, a walk in a park, whatever works for you.
- Some form of exercise: exercising will bring your energy levels back up, will improve the quality of your sleep, and will help release stress.
- Improve the quality of your sleep: I sometimes get insomnia because I get excited by my own ideas. I have found that taking valerian root at night helps. Also recently I have been experimenting with organic apple cider vinegar, honey and hot water, a drink made popular by Tim Ferriss. It is supposed to help with better quality sleep and less grogginess when you wake up. I have personally seen some improvements but it is yet too early to be conclusive.

## Conclusion

That's it for today. Please drop us some advice in the comments on what we can do to get out of crisis mode, I will add it to the list.

Good luck. 

Being in crisis mode sucks but being aware of it and looking for solutions is the first step!

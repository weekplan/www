We’ve done a lot of work to make Week Plan the best software to help align your execution and vision — a priority planner specifically built for effective people.

Each month, our engineering team prepares release notes, detailing high-level descriptions of Week Plan’s new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. Check them out.

# No More Calendar Permissions During Registration

No more calendar permissions when signing up. Prior to the latest update, users were asked to connect their calendar to Week Plan.

![](/assets/images/uploads/Image 2018-08-14 at 4.03.23 PM.png)Now we’ve made this optional for those who want to use their favourite calendar. Simply connect your calendar from the **Team Settings** option.

# Subtle Changes to the Pricing

We’ve made some changes to the pricing to better reflect the value you’re getting from Week Plan.

The **Pro** plan costs $2 per user each week, but is billed annually at $104 per year. There’s also an option to pay a monthly fee of $10. With the **Pro** plan, you can choose up to 3 premium features.

# BigRockAdvisor Appears Only at the Start of the Week

Notice the big blue block that sticks on the left side of your high impact tasks? We call that the **BigRockAdvisor**. It’s there to remind you to [schedule your priorities (HITs)](https://weekplan.net/what-is-essentialism-a-complete-guide-to-get-you-started/).

![](/assets/images/uploads/Image 2018-08-14 at 3.50.33 PM.png)The **BigRockAdvisor** used to stick there all the time, but we think it’s better if we show it to you only at the beginning of each week, for the first two days. Makes sense considering it’s better to plan your week on Mondays or Sundays.

# Renamed Goals to Objectives

We’ve been working on an entirely new feature that will make Week Plan better than ever. We’re  renaming the **Goals feature to Objectives** since we’re adapting the concept of OKRs. **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** is a framework for determining and measuring objectives and key results.

![](/assets/images/uploads/Image 2018-08-16 at 3.30.00 PM.png)OKRs have been used by companies like Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Uber. We’ll be rolling out this feature soon. So stay tuned.

# Bug Fixes

Lastly, our release notes will not be complete without the necessary bug fixes. The most notable bug fixes are the following:

* Fixed notes disappearing from task. 
* Performance issue fixed on Journal log.
* Close and save sidebar when pressing Enter.
* Fixed breadcrumb exception.
* Fix comment links. 
* Login issue fixed for Microsoft Outlook.
* Fixed error on cancelling Outlook Authentication.
* Fix subtask count and update issue.

## Add recurring tasks for your team that repeat whenever you want them to be

 

### **Setup recurring tasks by week, month or year**

Week Plan gives the control of your recurring tasks in your hand. Set a task that repeats daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.

 

### **Setup task frequency**

Quickly set up the frequency of how often you want a task to be repeated across multiple weeks.

 

### **Terminate a recurring task whenever you want**

Want to close a recurring task in an advanced date in future? Configure an end date with a task in future, and it will stop recurring whenever you want it to be.

 

## **How Week Plan helps boost team productivity using recurring tasks**

 

### **Automate Task Delegation - Save Time** 

You don’t need to ask your team and task progress every week. Automatically inform and get a status update at time and date you set.

 

### **Organize standup meeting and updates with remote teams**

Working with dispersed and remote teams can be complex and challenging. Automatically organize weekly recurring standups with your team, regardless of their time zone.

If you love using WeekPlan, chance is that other people might do as well. 




I have been working on WeekPlan for the past 3 years on my spare time, helped by a few talented contractors. The marketing budget is still very tight :) Would you help out?




As you know, a user's recommendation is always more convincing that the creator's pitch so I would appreciate if you'd accept checking out the following links and giving your honest opinion about WeekPlan.

Lots of people discover WeekPlan via twitter. [Tell people what you find special about WeekPlan](http://clicktotweet.com/7_89a).




## Your blog





  If you have got your own blog, how about showing people how you use WeekPlan yourself?<br/>
  Writing a blog post and including a link back to WeekPlan would be very useful because WeekPlan would start to rank higher in Google.

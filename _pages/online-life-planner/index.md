## What makes WeekPlan a great life planner?



WeekPlan is inspired by books like “7 habits of highly effective people” and “Getting Things Done”.   
Instead of trying to make you do as much as possible, it will help you focus on what matters. This is the difference between being productive and being **effective**.


WeekPlan makes you effective.


Not only WeekPlan is a great online life planner, but it also combines a personal diary to record your thoughts:

Want to close a recurring task in an advanced date in future? Configure an end date with a task in future, and it will stop recurring whenever you want it to be.

## **How Week Plan helps boost team productivity using recurring tasks**

### **Automate Task Delegation - Save Time**

You donâ€™t need to ask your team and task progress every week. Automatically inform and get a status update at time and date you set.

### **Organize standup meeting and updates with remote teams**

Working with dispersed and remote teams can be complex and challenging. Automatically organize weekly recurring standups with your team, regardless of their time zone.

## Add recurring tasks for your team that repeat whenever you want them to be

### **Terminate a recurring task whenever you want**

Want to close a recurring task in an advanced date in future? Configure an end date with a task in future, and it will stop recurring whenever you want it to be.

## **How Week Plan helps boost team productivity using recurring tasks** 

### **Automate Task Delegation - Save Time** 

You donâ€™t need to ask your team and task progress every week. Automatically inform and get a status update at time and date you set.

### **Organize standup meeting and updates with remote teams**

Working with dispersed and remote teams can be complex and challenging. Automatically organize weekly recurring standups with your team, regardless of their time zone. 

### **Available on all top platforms**

Let me tell you about the story of a man who was walking through a forest when he came across a frustrated lumberjack.
<p class="highlight">The man stops to observe the lumberjack, watching him sawing at this big tree. He noticed that the lumberjack was working hard, yet making little progress. The man noticed that the saw the lumberjack was using was not sharpened. So he says: "Excuse me but I couldn't help noticing how hard you are working on that tree but also that you are making only slow progress." to which the lumberjack replies: "Yes this tree is giving me some trouble." The man replies: "But your saw is dull, it cannot possibly cut through anything!" The lumberjack: "I know but I am too busy sawing to take time to sharpen my saw."

The point of the story is that you should take the time to sharpen your mind and body continuously to be better equipped in life. It could mean exercising regularly, reading, meditating and learning new skills.

Another practice is to keep a personal journal where you take the time to reflect on your day or week, and learn from it to better react the following day or week.

Writing will also help you maintain some perspective on what you do.

WEEK PLAN has a [journaling feature](https://app.weekplan.net/#view=Journal?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=wp&amp;utm_campaign=web_course) that is focused on self reflection. It invites you to reflect on what you have learned and what you could have done better.

Also, WEEK PLAN can send you a ["coaching email"](https://app.weekplan.net/#view=WorkspaceSettings?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=wp&amp;utm_campaign=web_course) which will send you an email"regularly with a question that will help you reflect on your life from a new perspective.
You can directly reply to that email and your message will be added to your journal in WEEK PLAN.

## Week Plan has everything your team needs to plan, manage and complete tasks.

### **High Impact Tasks**

Never lose sight of your most important tasks. Week Plan helps you integrate your high impact tasks into your schedule easily, so your team can focus on what matters.

### **Add Sub Tasks**

Subtasks help you create an organized work breakdown structure to effectively manage a big task. Add as many subtasks as you want, complete with description, deadlines, priority, and more.

### **Set Repetitive Tasks**

Save tons of time by setting up repeating tasks. Add recurring tasks like weekly meetings and reports — they’re automatically added to the schedule.

### **Track Time on Each Task**

Measure the time it took you to finish a task or allocate time to your team’s tasks with the built-in time tracker.

### **Centralize Your Important Tasks**

### **Prioritize Your Tasks**

Prioritize tasks by turning them into high impact tasks. Stop wasting time on unimportant stuff. Get a clear picture of what’s important and boost your team’s productivity.

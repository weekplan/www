## Wise Labs Pty Ltd – Terms Of Service

*Last Revised: May 2017*

This Terms of Service Agreement (the “Terms” or Agreement”) is an agreement between you (the “User” or “your”) and Wise Labs Pty Ltd (“Wise Labs” “we” us” or “our”). We work with Users to create an easy to use tool that can help manage their time and tasks. These Terms apply to your use of www.weekplan.net and any related websites or platforms, and all other online products and services (collectively, the “Service” or the “App”) related to WEEK PLAN. This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and your obligations to us. By using the Service in any way you are agreeing to comply with these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other legal notices or conditions or guidelines posted on the site or on the App. If you have been provided access to the Service through your relationship with a third-party company, you acknowledge that such company is not a party to this Agreement.

## Changes to these Terms

These Terms may be changed from time to time. You should review the Terms regularly to know about our practices. If changes are made, the date at the top of the policy will be updated indicating to you that a change has been made. We may at our discretion, provide you with additional notice (such as sending you an email notification). Any changes we make to these Terms will be effective when they are posted. If you use the Service after we have posted the changed Terms, then you have accepted the changes to these Terms.

## Privacy Policy

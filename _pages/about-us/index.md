My name is Aymeric Gaurat-Apelli, and I am the founder of Week Plan.

I am a software engineer who turned into an entrepreneur about 10 years ago. I have always been developing side projects for fun until some of them started to attract a lot of attention (1M users per day for some). I decided then to have a go at making a living from my own ideas and products.

Week Plan was born in 2010 from my own struggles to manage my time when I had a full time job as a software development consultant and managing my several online apps with millions of users. I tell you more about it in this video:

Week Plan is run under the Australian company I created called Wise Labs (you can find the [mission statement from 2010 here](http://aymeric.gaurat.net/2010/wise-labs-the-mission-statement/)).   

We are now a team of 8 people from around the world to help me create our vision:

**To help people and their organizations align their actions with their vision**

# PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER

Combining the two (Objective and Key Results), we now have effective OKR examples.

### **Example 1 (For Team/Individuals):**

**Objective:** Create a specific diet plan according to every athleteâ€™s track event

**Key results:**

1. 10% increase in stamina for long distance runners
2. 5% increase in speed of sprinters

### Example 2: (For Companies/Departments):

**Objective:**Increase in employee engagement

**Key Results:**

1. Decrease attrition rate from 7% to 3%
2. At least 3 activities executed within each department

### Example 3 (For Companies):

**Objective:** Increase company revenue by 10%

**Key results:**

1. Get 50 new customers by end of the first quarter
2. Reduce churn rate to 5%

The fundamentals of OKR may be old but is still very relevant up to this day. The framework has been spreading among individuals to companies and has significantly increased productivity.

While there may have been more other approaches that claim better results and numbers, the OKR approach remains a very solid and reliable one.

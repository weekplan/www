Goal setting methods have increased in number and relevance over the past couple of years. 

This is largely due to the emergence of new companies and organizations pushing to thrive in this competitive world. 

That's why it’s crucial to find new ways to measure your work on a regular basis. 

# INTRODUCING OKRS

Objectives and Key Results or OKRs is a popular approach in setting goals, implementing plans of action, and monitoring output. 

OKRs apply widely to individuals (employees), teams, and companies.

This framework is governed by a number of rules and strategies and has been effectively used by companies, particularly, in organizing employees to achieving their shared goals.

OKRs is a favorite tool for setting expectations and measuring results at organizations. Over the years, its process has now been more or less standardized.

So, what are OKRs? In a nutshell:

![](/assets/images/uploads/okrs.jpg)An **Objective** is a description of a goal to be achieved in the future. It sets a clear direction and provides motivation. It’s similar to a destination on a map.

A **Key Result** is a metric with a starting value and a target value that measures progress towards an **Objective**. 

A **Key Result** is like a signpost with a distance that shows how close you are to your **Objective**.

The **Objective** is qualitative, and the **Key Results** are quantitative.

The **Objective** sets a goal for a period of time, for example, a quarter. 

The **Key Results** then measure if the **Objective** has been met at the end of the time frame.

# HISTORY

OKRs date back to 1954 during the invention of **Management by Objectives (MBO)** by Peter Drucker, which was later on adopted by several companies like Intel, Google, and Twitter.

To this day, both companies, among other famous ones and startups, have been using OKRs as a goal-setting method. 

And it has consistently yielded favorable results.

# BENEFITS OF OKRS

The main benefit of OKRs is that it creates an organized dissemination of the companies’ goals to its employees. It connects the higher management to its employees, enabling teamwork across the board.

This kind of transparency improves the employees’ focus, determination, and helps them assess their own work and align it with the company’s mission and vision.

OKRs also enables employees to have a sense of pride and responsibility, knowing that they are part of something huge. In effect, leaders and movers are able to effectively supervise the direction the company is heading to.

Lastly, OKRs aren’t time-consuming to implement and follow through. For a couple of hours each quarter, you are able to check your performance and assess your progress. So, it’s very easy to use.

To review:

### What is an Objective?

An **Objective** describes the goal you need to achieve within a target date. It can be a personal goal, a team target, or a company’s vision and mission. Essentially, it jumpstarts the direction you are taking.

### What are Key Results?

**Key results** take all that inspirational language and quantify it. You set them by asking simple questions like, “How do we know if we have met our objective?”

More than usual, **OKRs** are interchanged with several goal-setting frameworks which are alike in a lot of ways.

# WHAT MAKES A GOOD KEY RESULT

So, what makes a good Key Result? Under each Objective, define measurable outcomes.

Key results should be quantifiable, achievable, and difficult, but not impossible. They can be based on growth, performance, revenue or engagement. Often, they are numerical, but they can also show if something is done or undone.

Key results take all that inspirational language and quantify it. You create them by asking a simple question “how would we know if we met our objective?”

This causes you to define what you mean by “awesome” “kill it” or “own.” Typically, you have three key results.  Metrics can be based on

·      Growth

·      Engagement

·      Revenue

·      Performance

·      Quality

Some types of key results usually start with verbs like launch, create, develop, deliver, build, make, implement, define, release, test, prepare and plan. These keywords jumpstart your vision for your team, organization or company.

Most times, your key result is going to be a specific metric and a value to reach. For example :

·       Get 50 new online users

·       Increase user retention from 40% to 60%

·       Reduce churn rate by 2%

# PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER

Combining the two (Objective and Key Results), we now have effective OKR examples.

Example 1 (For Team/Individuals):

Objectives: Create a specific diet plan according to every athlete’s track event

Key results:

1. 10%      increase in stamina for long distance runners
2. 5%      increase in speed of sprinters

Example 2: (For Companies/Departments)

Objective

Increase in employee engagement

Key Results

* Decrease      attrition rate from 7% to 3%
* At      least 3 activities executed within each department

Example 3 (For Companies)

Objective

Increase company revenue by 10%

Key results

·       Get 50 new customers by end of the first quarter

·       Reduce churn rate to 5%

The fundamentals of OKR may be old but is still very relevant up to this day. The framework has been spreading among individuals to companies and has significantly increased productivity.

While there may have been more other approaches that claim better results and numbers, the OKR approach remains a very solid and reliable one.

Goal setting methods have increased in number and relevance over the past couple of years. This is large due to the emergence of new companies and organizations pushing to thrive in this competitive world. 

That's why it’s crucial to find new ways to measure your work on a regular basis. 

# INTRODUCING OKRS

Objectives and Key Results or OKRs is a popular approach in setting goals, implementing plans of action, and monitoring output. 

OKRs apply widely to individuals (employees), teams, and companies.

This framework is governed by a number of rules and strategies and has been effectively used by companies, particularly, in organizing employees to achieving their shared goals.

OKRs is a favorite tool for setting expectations and measuring results at organizations. Over the years, its process has now been more or less standardized.

So, what are OKRs? In a nutshell:

An **Objective** is a description of a goal to be achieved in the future. It sets a clear direction and provides motivation. It’s also similar to a destination on a map.

A **Key Result** is a metric with a starting value and a target value that measures progress towards an **Objective**. A **Key Result** is like a signpost with a distance that shows how close you are to your **Objective**.

The **Objective** is qualitative, and the **Key Results** are quantitative.

The **Objective** sets a goal for a period of time, for example, a quarter. The **Key Results** then measure if the **Objective** has been met at the end of the time frame.

# HISTORY

OKRs date back to 1954 during the invention of **Management by Objectives (MBO)** by Peter Drucker, which was later on adopted by several companies like Intel, Google, and Twitter.

To this day, both companies, among other famous ones and startups, have been using OKRs as a goal-setting method. And it has consistently yielded favorable results.

# BENEFITS OF OKRS

The main benefit of OKRs is that it creates an organized dissemination of the companies’ goals to its employees. It connects the higher management to its employees, enabling teamwork across the board.

This kind of transparency improves the employees’ focus, determination, and helps them assess their own work and align it with the company’s mission and vision.

OKRs also enables employees to have a sense of pride and responsibility, knowing that they are part of something huge. In effect, leaders and movers are able to effectively supervise the direction the company is heading to.

Lastly, OKRs aren’t time-consuming to implement and follow through. For a couple of hours each quarter, you are able to check your performance and assess your progress. So, it’s very easy to use.

To review:

# WHAT IS AN OBJECTIVE

An **Objective** describes the goal you need to achieve within a target date. It can be a personal goal, a team target, or a company’s vision and mission. Essentially, it jumpstarts the direction you are taking.

# WHAT ARE KEY RESULTS

**Key results** take all that inspirational language and quantify it. You set them by asking simple questions like, “How do we know if we have met our objective?”

More than usual, **OKRs** are interchanged with several goal-setting frameworks which are alike in a lot of ways.

# OKR VS GOALS

An OKR is very similar to a goal, but very minor differences. Goals are usually nonspecific. They are encompassing. They drive you in a direction but without clear details and metrics on how to go about it.

It’s like planning to go to a country but without clear details on the date and daily itinerary.

The OKR approach allows very descriptive details on how to achieve the goals. Converting goals into OKRs is recommended for a few reasons.

With an OKR, your Key Results can reflect a number of important metrics that you'll be setting targets for in order to achieve your Objective.

Let’s discuss a few examples.

A sales agent’s target is revenue of $30,000. That is the goal. Following the OKR framework, we divide this goal into two important components: a direction (grow revenue) and a target ($30,000). Your goals are specific, but you can split it into two that answers the questions “where do I want to go?” and “how will I know I’m getting there?”

Another example of a goal is an increase in the number of restaurant branches in the metro. Using the OKR approach, the objective is an increase of restos in the metro. Our key results would be opening of 4 branches in the next 2 years.

In this way, we are able to see if the goals are reached or not by checking whether the key results are met or not. Goals are reached effectively by following and checking on the OKR approach.

Consequently, these two go hand in hand.

# OKR VS KPI

Key Performance Indicator or KPI is a type of performance measurement, aimed at evaluating the success of an ongoing process or particular activity.

KPIs can apply to projects, programs, products, and a variety of other initiatives. They can measure the success of anything from sales goals to social media metrics.

KPI measures the success, the output, quantity, or quality of an ongoing process or activity. Because of their complementary scope, OKRs and KPIs are natural companions.

In other words: OKR and KPI work perfectly together.

KPIs help monitor performance and identify problems and areas for improvement; OKRs help solve problems, improve processes, and drive innovation. You’ll need both.

Here is an example:

Let’s say you want to measure the success of your support team. You could create a KPI that measures the average reply time for incoming support ticket calls. If you agree with Support that the average reply time should be 30 minutes or less, you’ll be able to instantly see whether your target is met.

As long as that is the case, you’re all good. But what if the KPI indicates the average reply time currently is 48 minutes? You probably want to create an Objective to improve customer support. How would you know you’ve improved it or not? Well, if the average reply time drops from 48 to 30 minutes. So that would be your Key Result. What will you do to make that happen? You may want to hire an extra support manager, streamline processes or implement another approach or initiative.

# OKR VS BALANCED SCORECARD

The Balanced Scorecard has long been used as a strategic management framework used by companies across the world.

While it’s still a popular framework, the Balanced Scorecard has faced competition from other frameworks in recent years.

OKRs have been gaining usage and popularity as well. Usually, they may contain more initiatives for each objective, as well as more goals.

Using a science, the two share a lot of similarities. Both are focused on objectives—broad goals designed to propel the organization forward—and metrics (called [Key Results](https://www.perdoo.com/blog/set-key-results/) in the OKRs field and measures in the BSC) that gauge your success in achieving the objective.

The biggest difference between the two is cadence. When creating Balanced Scorecards, most companies will draft objectives and measures that are designed to stay in place for at least one year, but often longer.

With OKRs, however, most organizations change their Objectives and Key Results each quarter, focusing on what can create the most value in the next 90 days.

Another key difference relates to parameters. When constructing a Balanced Scorecard, organizations create objectives and measures in four distinct, yet related perspectives of performance: Financial, Customer, Internal Processes, and Learning & Growth.

OKRs on the other hand, do not rely on the use of perspectives.

Both tools are valuable in their own right, OKRs are more of an advantage having a shorter cadence. Since things are changing faster than ever, and thus it’s vital we have metrics that allow us to be agile in our approach, OKRs thrive more into this setting.

Having said that, the four-perspective model of the Balanced Scorecard also provides substantial benefits: it forces an organization to think holistically about their business and how the objectives and measures spanning the four perspectives weave together to tell their unique strategic story.

# WHAT MAKES A GOOD OBJECTIVE

First, the **Objective** should help in achieving the company goals and should be aligned with the corporate strategy or its vision.

You start by defining 3 to 5 objectives of the company, team or personal levels. Based on the earlier information, objectives should be qualitative, time-bound, and actionable by the person or team.

·      **Qualitative and Inspirational** - The objective is designed to get people jumping out of bed in the morning with excitement. And while CEOs and VCs may jump out of bed in the morning with joy over a 3% gain in conversion, most mere mortals get excited by a sense of meaning and progress. Use the language of your team. If they want to own it or kill it, use that wording.

·      **Time Bound** - The goal/s should be doable in a month, a quarter.  You want it to be a clear sprint toward a goal.

·      **Actionable by the Team Independently** - This is less a problem for start-ups, but bigger companies often struggle because of interdependence. Your Objective has to be truly yours, and you can’t have the excuse of “marketing didn’t market it.”

Following the rules, here we have a few examples.

·       If we take this objective ‘’Make our web application better,‘’ this objective is not definite. To make it effective, you should be specific on what you want to improve on. You can write another form of this objective to ‘’Reduce the time spent by our client to setup their account to 2 minutes’’, which is significantly more specific and distinct.

·       Instead of saying “Improve marketing team”, you can do better by saying “Improve marketers ability for writing article entries and social media posts ” so you can create several strategies later on.

·       To make the objective measurable,  “Make a lot of money” can be translated “Grow revenue by 15%” so that the key results have metrics put into place. It would be easier to compare the outcome by checking on the objectives first.

# WHAT MAKES A GOOD KEY RESULT

So, what makes a good Key Result? Under each Objective, define measurable outcomes.

Key results should be quantifiable, achievable, and difficult, but not impossible. They can be based on growth, performance, revenue or engagement. Often, they are numerical, but they can also show if something is done or undone.

Key results take all that inspirational language and quantify it. You create them by asking a simple question “how would we know if we met our objective?”

This causes you to define what you mean by “awesome” “kill it” or “own.” Typically, you have three key results.  Metrics can be based on

·      Growth

·      Engagement

·      Revenue

·      Performance

·      Quality

Some types of key results usually start with verbs like launch, create, develop, deliver, build, make, implement, define, release, test, prepare and plan. These keywords jumpstart your vision for your team, organization or company.

Most times, your key result is going to be a specific metric and a value to reach. For example :

·       Get 50 new online users

·       Increase user retention from 40% to 60%

·       Reduce churn rate by 2%

# PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER

Combining the two (Objective and Key Results), we now have effective OKR examples.

Example 1 (For Team/Individuals):

Objectives: Create a specific diet plan according to every athlete’s track event

Key results:

1. 10%      increase in stamina for long distance runners
2. 5%      increase in speed of sprinters

Example 2: (For Companies/Departments)

Objective

Increase in employee engagement

Key Results

* Decrease      attrition rate from 7% to 3%
* At      least 3 activities executed within each department

Example 3 (For Companies)

Objective

Increase company revenue by 10%

Key results

·       Get 50 new customers by end of the first quarter

·       Reduce churn rate to 5%

The fundamentals of OKR may be old but is still very relevant up to this day. The framework has been spreading among individuals to companies and has significantly increased productivity.

While there may have been more other approaches that claim better results and numbers, the OKR approach remains a very solid and reliable one.

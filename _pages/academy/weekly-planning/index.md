Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you have responsibilities to fulfill. 

From small things like walking your dog up to major milestones like starting a company, there are times when things get a little rough and you struggle to do tasks at hand. 

You’re not alone. The good news is you can master one skill that can change everything.

What’s it you ask? It’s the habit of weekly planning.

# What is Weekly Planning?

Weekly planning is the act of organizing your activities and tasks for the week. 

Ideally, you would do this on a Monday or a Sunday, with the help of tools such as a pen and paper, or an app that lives on your phone.

It can be as simple as writing a to-do list or as detailed as prioritizing tasks according to importance and urgency.

Either way, planning your week will make you a more productive and effective person.

* Weekly planning is simply organizing events in your calendar ahead of time.
* It gives you an overview of the tasks at hand and provides you with control over it.
* Weekly planning lets you know your priorities and keeps you on track.
* It’s the art of dividing your time wisely so you would be able to do everything you need to do.
* It lets you juggle tasks, even trivial ones, along with long-term projects.
* Weekly planning organizes your goals like a ladder, doing tasks one step at a time that would then eventually lead to a greater goal.

In a nutshell, weekly planning organizes your life. Who doesn’t want that, right? That’s why weekly planning is important.

# Why It’s Important to Plan Your Week

Consistently planning your activities for the week can be a challenge, but with practice, you’ll make it a habit. Here are a few reasons why planning your week is important:

* **Weekly planning lets you know what’s going on.** It’s your mom’s birthday on Friday? Then you can slip a trip to the mall for a gift on Wednesday. Knowing what’s going on devoid you from conflicts in schedule.
* And because you know what’s going on, you’d know if you need to do work on certain days. This then **teaches you to learn to say no** to sudden plans, especially those with less importance than what is in your calendar. Weekly planning gives you an understanding of certain aspects of your life like knowing priorities and sticking to them. And saying no is a big part of it.
* **Weekly planning also helps you maintain balance** in your schedule and in your life. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Life isn’t just about work. It’s a balance of both work and play.
* **Weekly planning makes you more productive**. Being productive doesn’t mean you’re always working though. It means you’re doing the right things. It’s being able to accomplish tasks correctly, not just finishing them, and being able to save time for other things.
* **Weekly planning prevents you from experiencing crisis**, a critical point in which everything seems urgent and important. By planning your week, you’re actually saving yourself from a lot of headaches.

# How to Plan Your Week

There are different ways to plan your week. But here are a few strategies, taken from experts, that will help you get started.

1. **Get ahead**. Plan your week before it starts. This is really effective, it lets you see how your week would be like and it helps you prepare your mind for it. It also gives you ample time to actually prepare for certain events, like that dinner date on Friday. Getting ahead lets you know what should be done at certain periods of time and lets you focus more on the task at the moment.
2. **Schedule everything on your calendar**. This is a quick way to organize your life. One look at your calendar lets you know what’s scheduled for each day in your week.
3. **Know your top priorities.** It may be that business proposal you’re thinking of, or that book you want to finish. Knowing your priorities lets you focus on important tasks, making you not just productive, but effective.
4. **Have a checklist for everything, and that means everything**. Every single thing you need to do that week. It can be detailed, or not. It all depends on you and how you organize your weekly plan. This gives you a view of the tasks at hand, allowing you to arrange them accordingly.
5. **Plan mellow times.** Take into consideration the time needed in between. Don’t try to stress yourself up. Add 15 minutes to that travel time, you’d never know how traffic will get. Add another 10 minutes or more for that meeting; you might want to catch up on people you know after. Just make enough time for everything. Avoid rushing yourself.
6. **Give time for unplanned events.** You never know what’s coming up tomorrow. You might run out of peanut butter and would need to go to the store. This can sometimes be stressful especially if you’re busy. So it would be very helpful to be able to reserve time for these things.

The best part of weekly planning is that it reduces stress. Knowing what needs to be done at certain times eliminates worry, like did you forget anything that you should be doing? It’s all the little things.

# Strategies to Stay More Focused

Now that you’ve assimilated the elements of weekly planning, such as the habit of putting first things first, you need to master the art of staying focused to consistently nail your goals. But how do you stay more focused? Here are some strategies to keep your eyes on the prize.

**Prepare your day the night before**

It may sound like a cliché, but preparing your day right is close to ending it as you expected it to be. Preparing your day the night before it is probably the easiest way to reduce fatigue.

There’s a huge gap between being busy and being productive. To avoid ending up not accomplishing anything after a long day, you have to set everything straight.

**Do the hardest things first**

Stop procrastinating and start doing. And if possible, do the difficult things first. The difficult ones are always the least we want to do. That is why we must do it first among many other tasks of the day.

If not, you’ll end up not ticking that off your list. Delaying its completion means adding workload the next day when in fact you could have longer periods of rest then. The shorter it stays on your plate, the better.

**Eliminate distractions and time wasters**

Discipline is about controlling your behavior in accordance with your vision and values. With discipline, you set your mind directly to the goal, not giving room for any distraction.

Sharon Salzberg once said, “_Distraction wastes our energy, concentration restores it_.”

And, concentration comes with discipline. If we avoid distractions and time wasters, we end up finishing tasks earlier or as planned.

**Manage your energy**

They say that time management is all about energy management. That’s why it’s best to know the amount of energy you need to use and when exactly to use them so you can distribute your energy in a timely manner. Do not multitask. You’ll end up exhausted and not getting things done by the end of the day.

**Set reminders for your most important priorities**

The necessary tasks come first. You should be consistent in terms of what to prioritize until it becomes a habit. But it’s easier said than done because it’s very easy to forget your priorities. This is where reminders come in.

Set reminders for your priorities. You can do this by leveraging the power of your smartphone or laptop. There are plenty of apps that you can download to help you get started.

**Write a not-to-do list**

This may come as a surprise for some, but it’s pretty effective.

If you’re a big fan of to-do lists, then you should consider writing a not to-do list, which is essentially a list of things that you shouldn’t be doing, like watching TV or playing games.

When you write a not-to-do list, you’re freeing yourself from things that could stress you out.

**Practice meditation**

Meditation is one of the best ways to improve your focus. It calms your mind, renews your energy, and keeps you focused on what truly matters. Studies show that meditation eliminates stress and prevents you from experiencing a breakdown. Consider taking yoga lessons or try installing meditation apps on your phone.

**Practice essentialism**

Essentialism is the deliberate practice of saying no and focusing only on what is truly important. It focuses on the priority, not the priorities. It’s about doing less, not more.

Greg McKeown puts it best: “_Essentialism is not about how to get more things done, it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing what is only essential_.”

**Exercise**

In addition to meditation, exercise is a great way to improve your focus. Moving around circulates blood throughout your body, especially to your brain, which gets to function the most. Exercise releases endorphins or ‘happy hormones’ which make you alert and active all day.

**Try the Pomodoro Technique**

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. This method uses a timer and breaks down tasks with an allotted time of 25 minutes each with short breaks in between. There are applications in some websites that you could download and if you want to learn more about how this technique is done.

**Avoid multitasking**

Multitasking is a big NO if you want to stay laser-focused on our goals. Juggling too many tasks altogether drains your energy and diverts your attention, making room for distractions. Most likely, you’d end up not completing your tasks for the day.

**Say no**

The yes guy appears accommodating and helpful, but deep inside, he’s super stressed, tired and out of focus. The lesson? Don’t be a yes guy. Say a lot of noes.

When you know you can’t do it effectively and efficiently, just simply say no. A single task perfectly executed is always better than a good number of flawed and unfinished ones.

**Work offline**

While technology has connected us to the world, it left many of us distracted. That’s why it’s important to use technology only to your advantage. In other words, use technology only when it benefits you.

Social media, online games, on-demand music, sand videos are perfect examples of the ironies of technology. If you want to supercharge your focus, try working offline.

Go to some place where there is no Internet. You’ll be amazed at how effective this strategy is.

All of these tactics are effective in helping you stay more focused. Use them consistently until such time that doing them becomes spontaneous like breathing. Finally, make them _good habits that die hard_.

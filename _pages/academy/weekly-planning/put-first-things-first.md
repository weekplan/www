# Put First Things First

Put first things first ­— a phrase that’s easier said than done. In this busy world, it’s very easy to lose sight of your goals. 

And because it’s impossible to have just one task on your list, you need to keep your ducks in a row. So, how do you do this?

There are different tools to help you put things first. But perhaps the best method is the Eisenhower Matrix. 

The matrix was later popularized by the late Stephen Covey in his best-selling book “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” 

Covey integrated ways to resolve professional and personal difficulties, thus the division of daily activities into four quadrants.

He incorporated this concept into what he called the third habit, which means to put things first. 

Putting first things first encourages you to adopt a way of life where life should be celebrated without compromising your responsibilities.

# What is the 3rd Habit

To fully understand the third habit, you need to revisit Stephen Covey’s first and second habits.

The first habit talks about being proactive. Going after what you want in life. Being responsible for your behavior, result and growth. Knowing that you are accountable for the things you do.

The second habit is, to begin with the end in mind. This means being able to envision the things you want in life. Like a building that needs a blueprint, you also need to contemplate on the things that you want to achieve.

Now, this is where the third habit comes in. Putting first things first perfectly complements Habit 1 (be proactive) and Habit 2 (begin with an end in mind).

So, what does Habit 3 mean? It means to act on your ideas, vision, and goals. Now that you have established a vision and taken responsibility for your life, it’s time to act.

However, the third habit is not focused on a single goal. On the contrary, it’s geared toward long-term goals that reap tremendous benefits.

Habit 3 is said to be the key to fulfillment. If you put more weight on the things that matter and make it a habit to live a life of value, you will have achieved greatness.

## What is Vision

Vision is knowing who you are (your purpose), knowing where you’re going (your picture of the future), and knowing the principles you need to guide your journey (your values).

Think of vision as your North Star, guiding you every step of the way and providing you direction whenever you get lost in the busyness of life.

Vision gives you clarity for the future while directing your attention in the present. On the contrary, the lack of vision prevents you from achieving success or significance in life.

“If you have a clear vision of where you want to go, you are not as easily distracted by the many possibilities and agendas that otherwise divert you,” says best-selling author Timothy Gallwey.

## 3 Elements of Vision

1. **Purpose** — The first element is purpose. Purpose is the reason why you exist. As an individual, your purpose is your why. For businesses, purpose is understanding what business you are in. A purpose isn’t focused on the individual or business. Instead, it’s all about making a difference and adding value.
2. **Picture** — The second element is your picture of the future. The key is to clearly visualize your ideal future. You need to have a clear picture of where you’re going and what you want to achieve. Visualize things and ideal outcomes.
3. **Core Values** — The third element — core values — are the tools you need to guide your decisions and actions. These principles shape your behavior and direct your actions to the right path. Examples of values are discipline, integrity, and honesty.

# The Purpose of Vision

It’s one thing to want something and it’s another to have a vision. Simply wishing for success to come into your life isn’t enough.

You need to have a vision that inspires you to achieve something greater than what you are and what you’ve accomplished. This is the purpose of vision — to paint a picture of the future that creates passion.

The world’s most successful people have clear, written vision statements that keep them focused on what truly matters. This is why it’s necessary to have a vision for your life.

Consider this vision statement by Sir Richard Branson:

> “To have fun in my journey through life and learn from my mistakes.”

And Oprah Winfrey’s vision statement reads:

> “To be a teacher. And to be known for inspiring my students to be more than they thought they could be.”

Writing a personal vision statement allows you to focus on your vision, future, and values. Whatever your vision is, you need to put it into writing. In the next sections, we’ll show you how to write a personal vision statement for you and your business.

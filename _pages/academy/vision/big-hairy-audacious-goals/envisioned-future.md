# ENVISIONED FUTURE

The year is 2050 and your company has grown from just 5 to 30,000 employees across cities around the world.

Your stakeholders are impressed with your company’s performance and the top management are receiving leadership awards for their valuable contributions.

The only problem is that 2050 is decades ahead of your time. Apparently, you were just dreaming.

You just saw what your Envisioned Future looks like. What is an Envisioned Future?

In addition to vision, core values, and BHAGs, another important tool to help you clarify your vision is the concept of the Envisioned Future.

As its name suggests, the Envisioned Future is a vision of what your future looks like as a result of your actions.

To define your own Envisioned Future, review your vision, core values, and BHAGs. Then start defining your desired destination.

Whether it’s selling your startup to a major industry player for billions of dollars or marrying your childhood sweetheart in a tropical paradise, having a clear Envisioned Future allows you to set strategic plans to achieve your BHAGs.

In a nutshell, the Envisioned Future is made up of two interdependent parts. First is the BHAG or the Big, Hairy, and Audacious Goal, and second is what they call the Vivid Description.

## Two Parts of an Envisioned Future

1. **External Vision or BHAGs** - As discussed in the previous sections, BHAGs are ambitious goals that are long-term, ideally spanning from 10 to 30 years. This is sometimes referred to as an External Vision, which is what a company wants to become as a result of its strategy.
2. **Vivid Description** - Meanwhile, a Vivid Description is an inspirational statement that describes in detail what the outcome will be when you achieve your BHAGs. In other words, it paints a clear picture of your world because you will have achieved your goals.

Combining both your BHAGs and Vivid Description will create your Envisioned Future.

**Example of a BHAG:** Henry Ford body said:

> “I'm going to democratize the automobile.”

**Example of a Vivid Description:** Henry Ford supported his BHAG by creating a vivid description. He said:

> “I will build a motor car for the great multitude. It will be so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one and enjoy with his family the blessing of hours of pleasure in God’s great open space. When I’m through, everybody will be able to afford one, and everyone will have one. The horse will have disappeared from our highways and the automobile will be taken for granted.”

Now that's a powerful Vivid Description. Mr. Ford clearly achieved his BHAG.

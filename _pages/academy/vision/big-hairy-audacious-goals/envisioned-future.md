# ENVISIONED FUTURE

The year is 2050 and your company has grown from just 5 to 30,000 employees across cities around the world. Your stakeholders are impressed with your company’s performance and the top management are receiving leadership awards for their valuable contributions.

The only problem is that 2050 is decades ahead of your time. Apparently, you were just dreaming.

You just saw what your Envisioned Future looks like. What is an Envisioned Future?

In addition to vision, core values, and BHAGs, another important tool to help you clarify your vision is the concept of the Envisioned Future.

As its name suggests, the Envisioned Future is a vision of what your future looks like as a result of your actions.

To define your own Envisioned Future, review your vision, core values, and BHAGs. Then start defining your desired destination.

Whether it’s selling your startup to a major industry player for billions of dollars or marrying your childhood sweetheart in a tropical paradise, having a clear Envisioned Future allows you to set strategic plans to achieve your BHAGs.

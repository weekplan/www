## What is a Personal Vision Statement

A personal vision statement is a brief statement that outlines your vision for your life. It’s mostly written and, in some cases, expressed in speech. 

In a nutshell, a personal vision statement is a paragraph that summarizes everything you would like to be. It gives you a clear view of what you want to accomplish and it’s the first step to putting all things into perspective — your decisions, actions, and attitude. 

When you write your personal vision statement, you’ll have a picture of what success and significance look like to you. Your vision statement serves as the guiding force of your life, constantly reminding you of what you want to become. 

What a Personal Vision Statement is:
- It’s a philosophy or creed that highlights what you want to be and do.
- It’s a personal constitution that governs your life.
- It’s a written standard — a criterion that is the basis for your daily decisions and actions.

For companies, a vision statement is an invisible hand that guides the people in the organization. A vision statement explains the organization’s reason for being and answers the question, “What business are we in?”

## WHAT IS A BHAG

BHAG stands for Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals. The term was introduced best-selling author Jim Collins in his book titled “Good to Great, Built to Last.”

Collins wanted to create a phrase that powerfully described what it means to have ambitious long-term goals that convey boldness, excitement, and energy. The rest was history.

A BHAG is a tool that fuels companies and individuals to set ambitious and emotionally-compelling goals.

In a nutshell, BHAGs are long-term objectives that, when achieved, will change the very nature of a company’s or person’s existence.

According to Collins, BHAGs can be almost impossible to achieve without real commitment and hard work. They’re also bigger, bolder, and loud. It’s like putting man on Mars.

However, BHAGs are what makes a company great. A BHAG is what distinguishes a great company from an average one.

## HOW CAN BHAGS HELP YOU

Setting Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals for you and your business can change how you think and act. It boosts your confidence, sparks passion, and breaks limitations within yourself and your team.

BHAGs create a paradigm shift, eliminating narrow-minded thinking and allowing you to see the bigger picture and your full potential.

Jim Collins puts it best:

> “The power of the BHAG is that it gets you out of thinking too small. A great BHAG changes the time frame and simultaneously creates a sense of urgency. It’s a real paradox.”

It’s worth noting that BHAGs are more than just goals because they’re often guided by your core values and purpose. This means that your big, hairy goals must be aligned with your company’s strategy. It’s not just an aspirational statement.

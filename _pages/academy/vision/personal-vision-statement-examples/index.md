Writing your personal vision statement isn’t easy as A, B, and C. You need to take everything — identifying your 3 elements of vision and answering the deep questions — and encapsulate them in a piece of writing. 

Since it’s unlikely you’ll get it down right on your first try, write as many drafts as you can until you’re comfortable with it. Write your vision statement first, and refine it later. Here are a few examples of personal vision statements:

## Google mission statement
“To organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”

## Facebook mission statement
“To give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.”

## Instagram
“Capture and share the world’s moments.”

## Microsoft
“Empower people through great software anytime, anyplace, and on any device.”

## Sony
“To be a company that inspires and fulfills your curiosity.”

## Zappos
“Our vision is delivering happiness to customers, employees and vendors.”

## Disney
“To make people happy.”

## Nike
“To bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. If you have a body, you are an athlete.”

## Tesla
“To accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.”

## IKEA
“Our vision is to create a better everyday life for many people.”

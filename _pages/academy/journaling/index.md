# What is Journaling

When people ask me how I started writing, I always remember the first time I attempted to write in my journal.

Well, I didn’t know what to write back then. It’s funny how I came a long way from not knowing what to write, to not knowing when to stop writing.

My journal became my best friend.

There are actually several types of journals you can try; one is a **daily journal** where you can write memorable moments in your life. Those giddy moments when you got your dog, that promotion at work you didn’t expect, those late-night rendezvous with someone special. Those things you experience and truly treasure.

Or you can write **expressive journals** where you can pour your heart out. A safe place where you can just be honest and even vent out your frustrations, just like not getting an extra slice of pizza, I feel you.

There are also **dream journals** where you write about your dreams and aspirations for the future, the things you want to achieve in life. Something you can read amidst bumps in your life as a reminder to never give up on yourself and your dreams.

Then, there are **travel journals** for your wild adventures. They’re a documentation of discovery — those new places with scenic views, the beautiful culture, unique food, and lovely people you meet.

There are different kinds of journals you can try, but journaling is just really about you, your life, your thoughts, and feelings rolled into words.

# The Importance of Journaling

I’ve always loved journaling; it became an escape route for me. Although we have different stories, one thing is for sure: we all had our fair share of trials in our lives. Experiences we don’t necessarily like but has made us stronger.

Writing can help you cope up with your feelings.

It may be anger for certain things or sadness from happenings you can’t control. It has the power to help you heal from all the feelings. Free you up from whatever is keeping you from moving on.

It can clear your mind and provide you with an awareness of what’s in hand for you. The secret is to write from your heart. It may sound very cliché, but it’s actually true.

Write your heart out unto your journal. Be honest about how you feel, write, like no one’s going to read. Being honest with everything that’s happening in your life, would certainly give you that sense of freedom.

We are nowhere near perfect, we make mistakes and we sometimes think and feel the way we shouldn’t. We tend to lie in front of others. We put up different facades to keep up with the norms. That’s where our journals can help.

There, you can be yourself. Say whatever you want to say. Be whoever you want to be, and no one will judge you for it.

# Benefits of Writing a Journal

There are definitely several benefits journaling can provide you. Here are some:

* Journaling clears your mind and emotions. When you write about your thoughts and feelings, it gives you more understanding about it. It neutralizes your emotions so you can switch to being logical about the matters at hand. You then reduce the stress you feel. You then learn to let go and just learn from the experience.
* Journaling enhances your creativity. We usually work for someone, so our workflow is led by someone else. Unfortunately, this usually limits our own creative ideas. When you write your own journal, you are your own boss and you can express every creative bone you can possibly possess.
* Journaling helps you manifest your goals. Writing can be a way to have a clarified view of the things you want in life, letting you set goals for them. These goals are what you’d strive for every single day. As you re-read your goals, you start to embody them and make them a part of you and every decision you make.
* Journaling reveals that inner writer in you. We all start somewhere. The best writers started writing about their daily experiences. You can never know how things would turn out. Who knows, you might be the next Stephen King.
* Journaling helps in daily recovery. What does this mean? Do you know people who work very hard and always have a hard time putting down work to be able to enjoy quality time with the family? Are you one of them? Well, journaling becomes somewhat of a therapy for you. It tells your mind that you’ve accomplished work today and it’s time to do something else. It’s just to relax and let go of all the paperwork.
* Journaling increases your gratitude. When you write about all the things that have been happening in your life and all the emotions that go with those experiences, you realize how many blessings you receive every day. These realizations help you feel more grateful for everything that’s happening in your life, leaving you with a much more positive outlook.

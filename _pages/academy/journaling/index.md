# What is Journaling

When people ask me how I started writing, I always remember the first time I attempted to write in my journal. 

Well, I didn’t know what to write back then. It’s funny how I came a long way from not knowing what to write, to not knowing when to stop writing.

My journal became my best friend. 

There are actually several types of journals you can try; one is a **daily journal** where you can write memorable moments in your life. Those giddy moments when you got your dog, that promotion at work you didn’t expect, those late-night rendezvous with someone special. Those things you experience and truly treasure.

Or you can write **expressive journals** where you can pour your heart out. A safe place where you can just be honest and even vent out your frustrations, just like not getting an extra slice of pizza, I feel you.

There are also **dream journals** where you write about your dreams and aspirations for the future, the things you want to achieve in life. Something you can read amidst bumps in your life as a reminder to never give up on yourself and your dreams.

Then, there are **travel journals** for your wild adventures. They’re a documentation of discovery — those new places with scenic views, the beautiful culture, unique food, and lovely people you meet.

There are different kinds of journals you can try, but journaling is just really about you, your life, your thoughts, and feelings rolled into words.

## The Importance of Journaling

I’ve always loved journaling; it became an escape route for me. Although we have different stories, one thing is for sure: we all had our fair share of trials in our lives. Experiences we don’t necessarily like but has made us stronger.

Writing can help you cope up with your feelings. 

It may be anger for certain things or sadness from happenings you can’t control. It has the power to help you heal from all the feelings. Free you up from whatever is keeping you from moving on. 

It can clear your mind and provide you with an awareness of what’s in hand for you. The secret is to write from your heart. It may sound very cliché, but it’s actually true.

Write your heart out unto your journal. Be honest about how you feel, write, like no one’s going to read. Being honest with everything that’s happening in your life, would certainly give you that sense of freedom.

We are nowhere near perfect, we make mistakes and we sometimes think and feel the way we shouldn’t. We tend to lie in front of others. We put up different facades to keep up with the norms. That’s where our journals can help. 

There, you can be yourself. Say whatever you want to say. Be whoever you want to be, and no one will judge you for it.

## Benefits of Writing a Journal

There are definitely several benefits journaling can provide you. Here are some:

* Journaling clears your mind and emotions. When you write about your thoughts and feelings, it gives you more understanding about it. It neutralizes your emotions so you can switch to being logical about the matters at hand. You then reduce the stress you feel. You then learn to let go and just learn from the experience.
* Journaling enhances your creativity. We usually work for someone, so our workflow is led by someone else. Unfortunately, this usually limits our own creative ideas. When you write your own journal, you are your own boss and you can express every creative bone you can possibly possess.
* Journaling helps you manifest your goals. Writing can be a way to have a clarified view of the things you want in life, letting you set goals for them. These goals are what you’d strive for every single day. As you re-read your goals, you start to embody them and make them a part of you and every decision you make.
* Journaling reveals that inner writer in you. We all start somewhere. The best writers started writing about their daily experiences. You can never know how things would turn out. Who knows, you might be the next Stephen King.
* Journaling helps in daily recovery. What does this mean? Do you know people who work very hard and always have a hard time putting down work to be able to enjoy quality time with the family? Are you one of them? Well, journaling becomes somewhat of a therapy for you. It tells your mind that you’ve accomplished work today and it’s time to do something else. It’s just to relax and let go of all the paperwork.
* Journaling increases your gratitude. When you write about all the things that have been happening in your life and all the emotions that go with those experiences, you realize how many blessings you receive every day. These realizations help you feel more grateful for everything that’s happening in your life, leaving you with a much more positive outlook.

## How to Start Journaling

How do you start writing a journal? Well, it’s simple — decide to do so. It’s where everything starts. It’s when you tell yourself, “I want to do this.”

Write about all the things you are thankful for in your life, start at even the little things like waking up to a beautiful morning today, the smell of coffee and breakfast when you got out of your room or even that traffic-less ride to work.

Write your appreciation for all the people around you, for that man who gave up his seat for you at the bus, that old lady that gave you a smile when you crossed the road, your wife who called you just to say I love you.

When you write, be honest. This is a cardinal rule in journal writing. Be honest with whatever is happening in your life and how you’re feeling about it. There might be things you don’t like. Still, write it down. It would help you make amends with the things that are bothering you.

Lastly, always incorporate your goals and aspirations in your first journal entry. After making amends with the things that are bothering you, move forward and work on the things you want. Start building what you want in your future, today. The key is to start now.

## Steps to Write a Journal

Here are some steps to help you start journaling today.

·      Choose where to write your journal. You can opt for a notebook or your laptop, whichever works for you.

·      If you chose to write your journal in a paper, choose a writing material. You can never go wrong with your favorite colored pens for your different moods and crazy ideas.

·      Set up a routine. It’s very important to include journaling in your schedule. Do it after you wake up or before you sleep. Make it a routine and stick with it.

·      Choose a setting that's conducive to writing. Go somewhere where you feel like writing. Grab a hot drink, play that music on. Get yourself in the mood for writing.

·      Date your entry. This can be a hassle but putting dates on your journal can be very helpful in the long run. Like determining what happened last week that might affect your feelings this week.

·      Start writing. Just do it. I know you always say you will today but can’t seem to start. You are not alone. But how can you enjoy writing when you can’t even start right? So start now.

·      Be creative. Don’t just write in your journal like your writing a log book. Write with feelings and thoughts. Try different methods like writing it in a form of poem or screenplay. You can draw on it, color it. Make it yours.

·      Know when to stop. Yah, I admit, this is where I struggle sometimes. But it can be too exhausting when you don’t know how to stop. That’s why you should bear in mind to put a limit when you’re writing. It can be how many pages, or how many sentences. It’s all up to you.

·      Reread what you’ve written, if you can. Rereading your journal gives you an insight into your own thoughts and feelings. It rewires your initial reaction on the matters at hand and can help you with your decision making.

·      Keep writing. Keep going. Don’t stop. Writing is a little hard at the beginning. There are times when you don’t know what to say or where to start. But it always gets easier the next time. You’ll eventually feel how calming it can be.

# What is Cogitorama

If you find journaling to be a little complicated and hard, then there’s a better option for you. Enter Cogiteroma, a different way to increase your self-awareness. It’s more like the Twitter of journaling.

Cogitoroma was created Aymeric Gaurat-Apelli, a software engineer turned entrepreneur who founded Week Plan. According to Aymeric, the concept of Cogitoroma was born when found himself too lazy to write journal entries as a student.

The name is derived from the Latin “cogito” which means “thought” and “orama” which is the Greek word for “see.”

For starters, write a few keywords that best describe your thoughts, feelings, and experiences at the moment.

So, for example, if you had a productive day at work, you would write: +productive day +meetings +closed deals -long day -no time for exercise.

Or, if you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed, you would write: -overwhelmed -stressed +talked to someone who offered help +found way to solve the problem.

If you notice, each keyword has a plus (+) and minus (-) sign. They describe how each keyword impacts you, whether positively or negatively. Get it? It’s quite simple. And it’s much easier than writing an entire journal.

The point of cogitorama is to remove the pressure of having to write a journal. With it, you can document your day in a minute. No need to spend hours thinking about what to write. Try it.

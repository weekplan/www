# Questions to Fire Up Your Journaling Habit

When people start writing their journals, they usually don’t know how to start, or what to write about. 

It’s okay. 

One does not need to be a writer to start journaling. You only need a pen and paper. 

And, more important, you need to start. 

That’s the key: start.

To build the habit of journaling, you need to start writing. Don’t worry about the grammar and spelling errors. 

What’s important is that you’re documenting your life. What matters is that you’re building the habit.

Writing journals can be easier by asking yourself a few questions. Here are some of the questions to help you get started.

1. First, you can ask yourself, **what** **were the significant events of the day?** It doesn’t need to be something big, it can be little moments that you consider significant and you’d never want to forget.
2. **In what way was this day different from other days?** Every day is a unique experience, you don’t really need drastic events, you can even write about how different you felt at school or work today compared to yesterday.
3. **Did you have any significant conversations?** You can never go wrong with conversations especially with those you love. Don’t forget those sweet words, write it down! It would be fun to read about them years from now.
4. **How did I feel during the day?** There would never be a day when you just feel significantly sad or happy. It’s always a mixture of different feelings. Write about the lows and ups of your day, the mixture of everything and how it all came to be.
5. **Was I worried about anything today?** Did something bother you? I always love this part. After you write your worries, it gives you sense of everything that comes with it. Why were you worried, and should you really be worried.
6. **What gave you particular happiness or joy?** What are the things that made you happy that day? Surely there would be a happy moment you’d always want to relive or remember for years to come.
7. **What did I accomplish today?** I had one-on-one meetings with my employees. That’s always on my journal because for someone who’s always busy, it’s a big accomplishment. See that? You can write anything you did that you felt proud of, how absurd it may sound.
8. **Did I fail at anything and what lesson did I learn?** Failure is always part of us, it helps in molding us into a better person, what did you fail on today? What did you learn from it? How can you apply what you learned in the future?
9. **Did I gain any insights into myself or someone else?** It’s amusing how different we can see something after we all write it down and take a gasp at the overview of everything.

If you find journaling to be a little complicated and hard, then there’s a better option for you.

Enter Cogiteroma, a different way to increase your self-awareness. It’s more like the Twitter of journaling.

Cogitoroma was created Aymeric Gaurat-Apelli, a software engineer turned entrepreneur who founded Week Plan.

According to Aymeric, the concept of Cogitoroma was born when found himself too lazy to write journal entries as a student.

The name is derived from the Latin “cogito” which means “thought” and “orama” which is the Greek word for “see.”

For starters, write a few keywords that best describe your thoughts, feelings, and experiences at the moment.

So, for example, if you had a productive day at work, you would write: +productive day +meetings +closed deals -long day -no time for exercise.

Or, if you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed, you would write: -overwhelmed -stressed +talked to someone who offered help +found way to solve the problem.

If you notice, each keyword has a plus (+) and minus (-) sign. They describe how each keyword impacts you, whether positively or negatively. Get it? It’s quite simple. And it’s much easier than writing an entire journal.

The point of cogitorama is to remove the pressure of having to write a journal.

With it, you can document your day in a minute. No need to spend hours thinking about what to write. Try it.

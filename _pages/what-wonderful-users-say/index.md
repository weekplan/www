> The most useful tool of the year - Yasir Nawaz

> I have tried so many task planners, life planners, goal trackers [...] While most of them had some amazing features, the system itself was too complex and I kept losing track of overall goals and getting drowned in the little tasks, recurrences, priority numbering systems etc. I needed a simple but strategic system which lets me keep my larger life goals and day-to-day tasks organized. I am so happy to have found Weekplan! It has the most intuitive, easy and visually appealing sleek interface. Planning tasks is a breeze leaving my focus on execution! The vision and journal areas are broken out into just the right sections to gently guide me to think through how to spend my week in a way that it aligns with my larger goals in life without requiring me to name and enter many levels of projects, task breakdowns, relationships etc. I love the roles because they help me keep track of my biggest goal in each of my roles without losing sight of one or dropping the ball on a few while juggling the others. This is just fantastic. Thank you! A million thanks for building this system! - Sam Anderson

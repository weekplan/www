People who have subscribed to this course actually like receiving our emails. Here are some examples of responses we have received:


*   <span class="pink">♥</span> I sincerely appreciate your efforts in sending such mails everyday, it really has added to my knowledge and hope I would implement this in my day to day life.
*   <span class="pink">♥</span> I would like to thank you for the daily emails I've been receiving. They've helped me in reflecting daily on how productive I have been. The email with the "I can't sharpen the saw because I'm busy sawing" kinda idea was really funny, but with a very simple, yet deep message. That really got on me. I now understand the importance of sharpening my own saw...so that my saw can be cut faster. [...]
*   <span class="pink">♥</span> I accidentally deleted the emails from day 1 &amp; day 2. Will you plese resend them to me? I am finding this all very helpful! Thanks
*   <span class="pink">♥</span> I am loving your emails and the weekplanner. I am a Franklin Covey devotee, but lost access to their software when I switched to a Mac. Thank you much.
